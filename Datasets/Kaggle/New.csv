1,BETHANIA PALMA,Donald Trump Called President Obama a ‘Lying N****r’?,"It is hardly a secret that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made some racially-charged comments since he announced his White House bid. In fact, he infamously launched his presidential campaign in 2015 by calling Mexican people (among other things) criminals.
Trump has also made a virtual avalanche of negative comments about President Barack Obama, some of which have no doubt been racially derogatory — including questioning his American citizenship. In one instance in July 2016, Trump implied Russian president Vladimir Putin had used the slur against Obama — a claim for which there is no proof.
Regardless, on 8 August 2016, a web site that appears to be dedicated to nothing but generating fake news stories published a piece saying that Trump called Obama the racial slur after a strange back-and-forth, for which there is no record. HotGlobalNews.com claimed that Trump called Obama a Muslim and then the two had a confrontation, during which the racial slur was flung.
HotGlobalNews also claimed that this exchange resulted in a lawsuit over whether Trump is qualified to be president due to his racism. (Needless to say, the site didn’t provide any source citations or video for this alleged exchange.) The web site also has headlines claiming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will star in an upcoming “Star Wars” film, and that Trump has already started on the promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico — even though the 2016 election has yet to be decided.
There are no other publications that documented what by all measures would be explosive news that would, if true, dominate the news cycle. While there has been much discussion over Trump’s views on ethnicity, including the fact that he has the support of known white supremacist David Duke, there is no proof that Trump called the first African-American president such an incendiary word.",FALSE,2016-09-01
2,DAN EVON,"What If Only Taxpayers Voted?

","On 28 August 2016, the web site The Burning Platform published an image purportedly showing what the electoral map would look like if only taxpayers had been allowed to vote during the 2012 election: However, the map displayed here was stolen from Buzzfeed, then republished alongside extremely inaccurate and misleading misinformation.  According to the blog post, the data in this image comes from CNN’s 2012 presidential race election poll (as noted in the bottom right-hand corner of this image).
However, by going to polling page itself, it’s clear that no one was asked if they were taxpayers — or if they were asked, that answer was not factored into the CNN map.
So where did the data actually come from? On 9 November 2012, Buzzfeed published an article featuring several electoral maps representing what the 2012 election would have looked like without universal suffrage. The map, therefore, is a doctored version of Buzzfeed’s map for 1920, which showed the results of the 2012 election if only white people (both men and women) had been allowed to vote:  President Barack Obama has been elected twice by a coalition that reflects the diversity of America. Republicans have struggled to win with ever-higher percentages of the shrinking share of the population that is white men — “a Mad Men party in a Modern Family world,” in the words of one strategist.
But at America’s founding, only white men could vote, and the franchise has only slowly expanded to include people of color, women, and — during the Vietnam War — people under 21. These maps show how American politics would have looked in that undemocratic past.
[…]
While women’s suffrage passed in 1920, there were still huge impediments to minorities to vote during that period, for instance in the form of poll taxes (only finally outlawed by the 24th Amendment in 1964). So here’s a version of the map that shows only white voters, men and women.
Other maps published in the same article used different metrics for comparison’s sake such as how the 2012 election would have looked like — for example — if only white men could vote, if only men (not just white men, but no women) could vote, if only people over age 24 could vote, and finally, how the 2012 election actually played out.",FALSE,2016-09-01
3,DAN EVON,Empire State Building Lit Green on 9/11 for Muslim Holiday,"In September 2016, several online articles (including items from fringe web sites such as Mad World News and the anti-Islam web site Bare Naked Islam) reported that President Obama was planning on lighting New York City’s iconic Empire State Building (ESB) green on 11 September 2016 in honor of Eid-al-Adha, the Muslim holiday that celebrates the willingness of Ibrahim (i.e., Abraham) to sacrifice his son at God’s command:
The Empire State Building is an iconic building in New York City often that lights up different colors throughout the year for various Holidays and special events. Many people don’t realize that is has been lit Islamic green in the past to celebrate their most sacred of Holy days. With 9/11 approaching Obama has plans to light it Green once again which should infuriate most Americans considering he sides with Muslims on everything.
Such an action (i.e., honoring a Muslim holiday on 9/11 in New York) would, of course, be considered highly insulting, given the events of 11 September 2001.
However, although the Empire State Building did shine green on the evening of 6 July 2016 in celebration of Eid al-Fitr (the Muslim holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan), it will not be so illuminated on 11 September 2016. According to the ESB Tower Lights calendar, on that date the building will be lit “Red, white and blue in memory of September 11.”
Moreover, since the Hijri (i.e., Islamic) calendar is lunar rather than solar, dates of major Islamic festivals are determined by lunar sightings. Although the start of Eid-al-Adha was originally expected to fall on 11 September in 2016, a number of prominent Muslim organizations have since declared that the festival will actually begin on 12 September this year:
For Muslims, Eid al-Adha commemorates the day when prophet Abraham was going to sacrifice his son but was instructed by God to offer an animal instead. Eid al-Adha in Arabic literally means “festival of the sacrifice”.
Eid al-Adha 2016 was expected to begin on Sunday, September 11. But on Friday September 2, the supreme court in Saudi Arabia announced that the Muslim festival of Eid will be on Monday, September 12.
The actual dates of Eid are confirmed based on moon sighting. If a new moon was sighted on September 1, then the first day of Eid al-Adha would have been on September 11. But since the moon was not visible, the festival will be celebrated on Monday, September 12. 
The Empire State Building is lit in various colors throughout the year to mark the occasion of various holidays and special events. For instance, it has shone blue and white for Chanukah, red and green for Christmas, and pastel colors for Easter. The Empire State Building has been illuminated green for Eid al-Fitr since at least 2007.
It should be noted that the Empire State Building is privately owned, and its lighting schedule is therefore not set by President Obama.",FALSE,2016-09-06
4,DAVID EMERY,"Did Obama Call Americans ‘Lazy’ in an Overseas Speech?
","Barack Obama became the first sitting United States president to visit the country of Laos on 5 September 2016, when he arrived there to participate in a summit of Southeast Asian nations. On the first day of his trip, President Obama met with Bounnhang Vorachith, the president of Laos, then traveled the next day to Luang Prabang in the northern part of the country to tour a Buddhist temple and participate in a town hall meeting with members of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI). 
A wide range of matters were discussed during the lengthy question-and-answer session, notably the future of U.S.-Southeast Asia relations, the importance of youth participation in government, prospects for international trade agreements, the challenges of climate change and environmental protection, and global health concerns.
Interestingly, though, as far as certain politically-oriented blogs and web sites were concerned, the only thing newsworthy that happened at the event was Obama twice uttering the word “lazy” in the context of addressing some of the aforementioned challenges.
According to these sources, Obama out-and-out called Americans “lazy” in both instances. Here, for example, is how the conservative web site The Federalistreported his remarks:
During a townhall meeting in Laos, President Barack Obama called Americans “lazy” multiple times.
For one, Obama said Americans’ reluctance to embrace his favored environmental policies is a sign of laziness.
“Usually when you see the environment destroyed, it’s not because it’s necessary for development,” Obama said. “It’s usually because we’re being lazy and we’re not being as creative as we could be about how to do it in a smarter, more sustainable way.”
He also accused Americans of being isolated and ignorant because the United States is such a big country.
“The United States is and can be a great force for good in the world. But because we’re such a big country, we haven’t always had to know about other parts of the world,” he said. “If you’re in the United States, sometimes you can feel lazy and think we’re so big we don’t have to really know anything about other people.”


Looked at objectively, it’s plain to see Obama’s statements were misrepresented in both cases. Beginning with the first, the claim that Obama said words to the effect of “Americans’ reluctance to embrace his favored environmental policies is a sign of laziness” is flat-out false.
As is clear from the full context of his remarks — which were in response to a direct question about reconciling the seemingly conflicting ideals of economic development and environmental protection — Obama was making the point that economic development doesn’t have to come at the cost of the environment. When environmental destruction does occur, he was saying, it’s because we aren’t trying hard enough to figure out how to develop sustainably:
And so part of the thing for young people like you, whether you’re in government or an NGO, you’re going to have to learn the best practices so that you can still grow, but you do so in a way that can be sustained over a long period of time.  And look, the United States is still learning how to do this, and we’ve been at it a long time.  But we used to have terrible pollution everywhere.  And we ultimately passed laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, and what we discovered was when you set rules to preserve the environment, that companies will adjust, and they’ll find new and innovative ways to make the same products and make the same amount of money, but do it in a way that actually is good for the environment.
So usually, if you see the environment destroyed, it’s not because that’s necessary for development.  It’s usually because we’re being lazy, and we’re not being as creative as we could be about how to do it in a smarter, sustainable way.
In the second instance, Obama is accused of accusing Americans, because they live in a big country, of being lazy, isolated and ignorant. Once again, let’s check the context. First, here’s the question Obama was asked:
Good afternoon.  I’m from Thailand.  And my question is, in the next 10 years, what do you expect ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] people to think about the U.S.A, and why?
And here is Obama’s complete answer:
Well, my hope is, is that the next President will continue my policy of meeting regularly with ASEAN leaders.  We are working on a whole range of different issues, from how can we help develop health care networks so that people are getting better health care, but also so that we identify if there’s a disease and we can stop it before it starts spreading, to disaster relief, so that if there’s a typhoon that there’s local capacity to respond quickly, to economic development, to education.  And some of these programs, they’ll take some years before they’re approved.  And my hope is that 10 years from now, people will look back and they’ll say that the engagement that we began with ASEAN now has developed so that we have a very mature and deep relationship in all areas. 
And I believe that the United States is and can be a great force for good in the world.  But because we’re such a big country, we haven’t always had to know about other parts of the world.  If you are in Laos, you need to know about Thailand and China and Cambodia, because you’re a small country and they’re right next door and you need to know who they are.  If you you’re in the United States, sometimes you can feel lazy and think we’re so big we don’t have to really know anything about other people.
And that’s part of what I’m trying to change, because this is actually the region that’s going to grow faster than anyplace else in the world.  It has the youngest population, and the economy is growing faster than anyplace.  And if we aren’t here interacting and learning from you, and understanding the culture of the region, then we’ll be left behind.  We’ll miss an opportunity.  And I don’t want to that to happen.
The context shows that Obama did not accuse Americans of anything, much less being lazy, isolated, and ignorant. To be sure, he did say: “…sometimes you can feel lazy and think we’re so big we don’t need to know anything about other people.” But to call that an “accusation” is a misrepresentation. In context, it was a folksy way of stating a plain fact: When you’re a superpower it’s all too easy to rest on one’s laurels and pass up opportunities to engage with other countries — to one’s own detriment.
“There needs to be more engagement between the U.S. and Southeast Asia” would be a fair summary of President Obama’s overall message to these potential leaders of their respective nations. One need not agree with that message, but in the interests of honest debate one ought not to misrepresent it, either.",Mostly False,2016-09-06
5,DAN EVON,"Ivanka Trump’s ‘Lap Dance’ with Donald
","In September 2016, a photograph purportedly showing a 15-year-old Ivanka Trump “grinding” on the lap of her famous father, Donald Trump, during a Beach Boys concert in 1996 at the family’s estate in Florida was circulated by web sites such as Winning Democrats as looking “too much like a girl grinding on her boyfriend’s lap”:

How many times can the creepiness of the Trump family seriously shock us? I mean…Trump has stated that he would date his own daughter, asked strangers if they thought she was hot, told a live morning show crowd the thing he had most in common with her was sex and groped her live on stage at the Republican National Convention. What could be worse than that?
The answer is, of course, the pictures. It seems that Donald’s creepy obsession with Ivanka Trump began when she was very young. It’s just…disturbing. Surely you’ve seen them and surely they’re emblazoned on your mind. The latest to emerge, however, could be the worst yet, because it’s Ivanka who seems to be the one truly enjoying herself … a little too much. Could it be she did all she could to keep Lord Cheeto happy to avoid severe consequences? Who knows. All I know is that this looks way too much like a girl grinding on her boyfriend’s lap.
Although this photograph is genuine, it is not in itself evidence of some form of improper relationship between Donald Trump and his daughter. While some may view this image as evidence that Trump has a “creepy obsession” with Ivanka, others see it simply as a picture of a father and his teenaged daughter enjoying a concert together.
This photograph was published by Getty Images on 1 January 1996 with the following caption:
Partygoers, including Ivanka Trump (center, in white) who her sits on her father, businessman Donald Trump’s lap during a concert (by the Beach Boys) at the Mar-a-Lago estate, Palm Beach, Florida, 1996. Also visible seated front row left is Trump’s wife Marla Maples.
We note that this picture captures a fleeting moment, and without additional photographs (or video) of the event, it’s impossible to say whether Ivanka was sitting on her father’s lap for a prolonged period of time or for just a few seconds (or whether, despite the captioning, she was actually on his lap at all).
While late-night comedians have frequently mocked Trump for having an improper relationship with his daughter, those accusations are all based on speculation rather than solid evidence.",Mixture of True and False,2016-09-08

Would I be extremely disappointed if she (Chelsea) chose to marry a black man? Yes. Would I stop loving her? No, absolutely not. 
However, we found no evidence of Clinton making this remark, or even giving an interview to Seventeen at all in 1995. Clinton was First Lady at the time, and if she had made such a remark it would have been covered by various media outlets. It would also have been out of character at the time for Seventeen, a publication largely devoted to celebrities, fashion, and dating, to publish an interview with the First Lady.

Two years ago, Donald Trump’s Twitter account sent a public message out to the world to “even the haters and losers” — on September 11, the twelve-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.
Trump’s tweet read: “I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th.”
But with Trump currently leading the pack of Republican presidential candidates, the original tweet from the morning of September 11, 2013 vanished from his account.

8,BETHANIA PALMA,"Donald Trump Meets With Anti-Gay Hate Group That Was Shunned by Other Candidates?
","On 12 September 2016, the LGBT-focused blog PinkNews reported that GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump attended an event held by “a listed anti-LGBT hate group – that every other Republican nominee has snubbed for more than a decade.”
While it is true that the Family Research Council, which hosts the annual Values Voter summit, has been listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-LGBT “extremist” group, the claim that the event was “snubbed” by a more than a decade’s worth of Republican presidential candidates is unsupported. As evangelical Christians remain a key voting bloc for the party, the Values Voter summit is a key event for Republican lawmakers. Further, the summit was launched in 2006, and has thus (as of the 2016 presidential elections) existed no longer than a decade.
The 2016 summit, held between September 9 and September 11, was attended by Trump and also Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus.
In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney addressed the summit by video-recorded message and his running mate, Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, spoke in person. Romney personally attended and spoke in 2011, though he was not a candidate at the time. In 2008, Arizona Sen. John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, were invited but didn’t attend the summit. It is unclear why they did not attend, but McCain spoke at the event in 2007.
In the course of the 2016 event, Trump gave his stump speech, praising FRC president Tony Perkins, blasting his rival Democrat, Hillary Clinton, and courting evangelical voters:

9,KIM LACAPRIA,President Obama Is Giving Mexico $75 Million to Build a Southern Border Wall,"In September 2016, a number of web outlets published articles asserting that President Obama was providing Mexico with $75 million in order to construct a wall on that country’s southern border (i.e., the frontier between Mexico and Guatemala and Belize). Items about President Obama’s investment in a Mexican wall were published to many blogs and Facebook pages, with one popular version stating:
You have got to be kidding me! After all the times that Trump has been attacked by the Democratic side of our society for saying that we need a wall on our Mexican border to stop illegals from getting into our country and destroying our economy, Obama just pulled the most hypocritical and pointless move of his career.
Obama just gave a ‘gift’ of $75 MILLION to Mexico to provide material and equipment for the building of a border wall on Mexico’s SOUTHERN border and to help cover the expense of training to help man the wall properly.
Another version of the rumor maintained:
Turns out Barack Obama isn’t all that against building a border wall to keep out illegals after all.
Thing is, he wants illegals to enter America, he’s just not okay with them entering Mexico.
Looks like the U.S. is giving our neighbors to the south $75 million so they can build their own wall to protect themselves from Central American invaders.
Most such articles cited a 15 September 2016 Newsmax piece whose only reference to a wall was a metaphor, mentioning an “invisible wall” along Mexico’s southern border with Central America:
Amid talk of Donald Trump’s plans to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico, Mexico itself has an invisible wall along its southern border with Central America as migrants head north.
A Financial Times story details Mexico’s role in stopping people from getting into its country from Guatemala. A reported 175,000 Central Americans were deported from Mexico in 2015 (a 68 percent jump from 2014), and so far in 2016 that number is approaching 100,000.
The Times claims the U.S. is sending Mexico $75 million in the form of equipment and training to help shore up its southern border. Ultimately, some of the Central American migrants wind up at America’s southern doorstep. Stopping them from entering Mexico is the first line of defense.


Newsmax in turned linked to a 14 September 2016 Financial Times article (virtually inaccessible behind a paywall) that described how Mexico had essentially become a (metaphorical) “wall” against migrants from Central American countries attempting to flee to the U.S. That article referenced the $75 million figure, clearly noted as being for “equipment and training” and not the construction of a wall:
“Mexico has become a wall for migrants,” said Sister Magdalena Silva, co-ordinator of Cafemin, a privately run shelter in Mexico City that takes in refugee families, including Rosa’s. “The current policy is to arrest migrants to stop them from getting to the US border.”
Although Mexico grants asylum to more Central Americans than does the US, Sister Magdalena estimates about seven out of 10 people who stay in her shelter still end up heading north.
Rosa and her sons just joined that count: after weeks in limbo waiting on the appeal, they finally threw in the towel after the youths witnessed a woman lying in a pool of blood just blocks away from the shelter.
“I don’t want them growing up thinking this is normal and happens everywhere,” says Rosa. The family travelled to the US, turning themselves in at the US border to ask for asylum. After a few weeks in detention, Rosa and her 14-year-old son were released to live with a family in Baltimore pending a decision. As an adult, her 19-year-old son is still in detention and could get deported.
The US is coy about its role in Mexico’s crackdown but is sending $75m in equipment and training to help stop Central Americans from crossing illegally into Mexico. Hosting Mr Trump, President Enrique Peña Nieto said that “making Mexico’s border with our friends and neighbours in Central America more secure is of vital importance for Mexico and the US”.
Ultimately, what all those articles referenced was a February 2016 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report on “U.S.-Mexican Security Cooperation” that mentioned plans for the U.S. to provide “at least $75 million” in assistance to Mexico. However, that money would not be given to Mexico for the construction of a physical wall (which would largely be impractical given the geography of the region), but rather it would be provided in the form of U.S. training and equipment assistance (e.g., nonintrusive inspection equipment, mobile kiosks, canine teams, immigration agents) to help Mexico secure their southern border and better deal with shared U.S.-Mexico concerns over drug trafficking and immigration:
One element of concern regarding enhanced bilateral border security efforts is that of southbound inspections of people, goods, vehicles, and cargo. In particular, both countries have acknowledged a shared responsibility in fueling and combating the illicit drug trade.
Historically, Mexican Customs had not served the role of performing southbound (or inbound) inspections. As part of the revised Mérida Initiative, CBP has helped to establish a Mexican Customs training academy to support professionalization and promote the Mexican Customs’ new role of performing inbound inspections. Additionally, CBP is assisting Mexican Customs in developing investigator training programs and the State Department has provided over 148 canines to assist with the inspections.
Policymakers may also seek to examine a relatively new element under pillar three of the Mérida Initiative that involves U.S. support for securing Mexico’s porous and insecure southern borders with Guatemala and Belize. With U.S. support, the Mexican government has been implementing a southern border security plan since 2013 that has involved the establishment of 12 advanced naval bases on the country’s rivers and three security cordons that stretch more than 100 miles north of the Mexico-Guatemala and Mexico-Belize borders. Mexico’s National Institute of Migration (INAMI) agents have taken on a new enforcement directive alongside federal and state police forces. These unarmed agents have worked with the military and the police to increase immigration enforcement efforts along known migrant routes. While several U.S. officials have praised Mexico’s efforts, human rights groups have criticized Mexico for abuses committed by its officials against migrants, for failing to provide access to humanitarian visas or asylum to migrants who have valid claims to international protection, and for detaining migrant children.
The State Department has provided $15 million in equipment and training assistance, including NII [nonintrusive inspection] equipment, mobile kiosks, canine teams, and training for INAMI officials in the southern border region. It plans to spend at least $75 million in that area. The Department of Defense has provided training and equipment to Mexican military forces as well. Observers have urged U.S. policymakers to consider providing Mexico with support in how to investigate and punish crimes against migrants, training in how to conduct humanitarian screening, and support for Mexico’s asylum agency. 
As the report indicated, the State Department (not President Obama) “plan[ned] to spend” approximately $75 million in total over an unspecified period of time in a joint effort between the U.S. and Mexico to manage their borders. Those funds will go towards providing equipment and training, not bricks and mortar.",Mostly False,2016-09-22
10,DAN EVON,"Police Union Cancels Trump Endorsement
","On 16 September 2016 the largest police union in the United States, the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), announced their endorsement of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
Four days later Trump disgruntled a good many police when, during a campaign event at the New Spirit Revival Center in Ohio, he suggested that Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby — who had just been involved in the controversial fatal shooting of Terence Crutcher — had erred because she was “scared” or “choking”:
“I watched the shooting, in part, in Tulsa, and that man was hands up,” Trump said. “That man went to the car, hands up, put his hands on the car.
“To me, it looked like he did everything you’re supposed to do. The young officer — I don’t know what she was thinking. But I’m very, very troubled by that.”
“These things are terrible. That was, in my opinion, a terrible, terrible situation,” Trump said.
“Did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? People that do that — maybe they can’t be doing what they’re doing,” Trump said. 
This turn of events led to claims circulated via social media that the FOP had retracted their endorsement of Trump:

Although the FOP’s executive director chided Trump over his remarks, the police union did not actually withdraw its endorsement of the GOP candidate:
The Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Trump, and that endorsement still stands, said Jim Pasco, the group’s executive director. But of Trump, said Pasco, “he must be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all, including police officers.”",FALSE,2016-09-22

","A graphic featuring an image of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg next to a quote ostensibly uttered by him about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, referring to the GOP candidate as “con artist” and a “cheat,” has been widely circulated on social media:

I have known Trump for decades. We have traveled in the same business circles. He is known among other millionaires as a con artist and among business owners as a cheat out to stiff everyone.
The text of this image first started circulating in July 2016, shortly after Bloomberg made an appearance at the Democratic National Convention to endorse Hillary Clinton. Bloomberg issued several remarks critical of Donald Trump during his DNC speech, including referring to his candidacy as a “con” and mocking his business acumen, but he did not say the words attributed to him above.
A full transcript of Bloomberg’s speech can be found here, while the relevant portion has been reproduced below:

I’m a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one! Trump says he’ll punish manufacturers that move to Mexico or China, but the clothes he sells are made overseas in low-wage factories. He says he wants to put Americans back to work, but he games the US visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages. He says he wants to deport 11 million undocumented people, but he seems to have no problem in hiring them. What’d I miss here?!
Truth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy. He wants you to believe that we can solve our biggest problems by deporting Mexicans and shutting out Muslims. He wants you to believe that erecting trade barriers will bring back good jobs. He’s wrong on both counts.
We can only solve our biggest problems if we come together and embrace the freedoms that our Founding Fathers established right here in Philadelphia, which permitted our ancestors to create the great American exceptionalism that all of us now enjoy. Donald Trump doesn’t understand that. Hillary Clinton does. And we can only create good jobs if we make smarter investments in infrastructure and do more to support small businesses. Not stiff them. Donald Trump doesn’t understand that. Hillary Clinton does.
I understand the appeal of a businessman president. But Trump’s business plan is a disaster in the making. He would make it harder for small businesses to compete, do great damage to our economy, threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans, lead to greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence in the world, and make our communities less safe.
The bottom line is: Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice. And we can’t afford to make that choice.
Nonetheless, some newspapers misquoted Bloomberg and reported that he had referred to Trump as a “con artist”:
As Michael Bloomberg said perfectly about Trump during his speech at the Democratic convention in July: “I’m a New Yorker — and I know a con artist when I see one.” 
It was Florida senator Marco Rubio who referred to Trump (more than once) as a “con artist” during the campaign for the Republican nomination:
“We are so excited about what lies ahead for our campaign,” Rubio said. “You see, just five days ago, we began to unmask the true nature of the front-runner so far in this race. Five days ago, we began to explain to the American people that Donald Trump is a con artist.”
“Two weeks from tonight right here in Florida we are going to send a message loud and clear,” Rubio said. “We are going to send the message that the party of Lincoln and Reagan and the presidency of the United States will never be held by a con artist.”",FALSE,2016-09-23

","The 20 September 2016 killing of Keith Lamont Scott by police Charlotte, North Carolina, prompted to several nights of protests in that city, along with rumors that Black Lives Matter (BLM) demonstrators attacked and beaten a homeless veteran simply because he was white — with the evidence captured on video:

This video clip was widely circulated online in conjunction with the claim that it depicted events in Charlotte. However, many viewers pointed out the red double decker buses viewable passing by in the background of the clip are not a common feature in Charlotte, and that the clip actually originated in London and had nothing to do with Black Lives Matter protests.
That what the video captured took place in London and not Charlotte is documented by a 22 September 2016 British tabloid article that reported on an incident just like the one seen in the video:
Sickening footage has emerged of an elderly man being kicked to the ground in what appears to be an unprovoked attack.
The incident is believed to have taken place in the Stratford Centre area of London and was published on Twitter.
Police have launched an investigation and will be carrying out enquiries around the suspected location in an attempt to identify the victim and suspects.
A victim, a man with a white beard and hair, is caught unaware by the vicious attack as he stands at a rubbish bin.
As reported, the attack occurred in London and had nothing to do with Charlotte or the Black Lives Matter movement, and the homeless victim (presumably also from London) was not described as a “veteran” or recipient of the Purple Heart award.",FALSE,2016-09-26
13,DAVID EMERY,"Was Donald Trump Against the Iraq War from the Beginning?

","One bone of contention between 2016 GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, is that she, famously, voted in favor of the 2003 invasion of Iraq as a member of the U.S. Senate, and he, supposedly, opposed it. Trump made much of his alleged opposition to the Iraq War throughout the presidential campaign, calling the incursion a “mistake.” During a Republican debate in February 2016, Trump said, “I’m the only one on this stage that said, ‘Do not go into Iraq, do not attack Iraq.’ Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong.”
In June 2016, Trump declared that the Iraq War set in motion a chain of events that led to the rise of the terrorist group ISIS, saying that Hillary Clinton’s vote in favor of it was indicative of her poor judgment. “In short, Hillary Clinton’s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another,” Trump said. “It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place. Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.”
Despite mainstream media challenges to the accuracy of the latter claim, Trump repeated it during the first presidential debate in September 2016. “I was against the Iraq war,” he fired back after moderator Lester Holt said he Trump had supported it. “The record shows that I’m right.”
Is he? Does the record show that Trump was against the Iraq War before it started? Let’s examine his public statements, beginning with his first known comment on the notion of invading Iraq, made during a 2002 radio talk show interview.
The Howard Stern Show, 11 September 2002 (six months before the war):


STERN: Are you for invading Iraq?
TRUMP: Yeah, I guess so. You know, I wish the first time it was done correctly.


If that remark wasn’t exactly a wholehearted endorsement of the notion of invading Iraq, it clearly wasn’t an expression of opposition to the idea either.
Fox News interview with Neil Cavuto, 31 January 2003 (two months before the war):
In January 2003, with an invasion of Iraq looming, Fox News interviewer Neil Cavuto asked Trump what kind of advice he would give to President Bush. Trump waffled, expressing neither support nor opposition to the concept of invading Iraq and offering no more cogent an opinion than that President Bush should make up his mind one way or the other:


CAVUTO: If you had to sort of break down for the president, if you were advising him, how much time do you commit to Iraq versus how much time you commit to the economy, what would you say?
TRUMP: Well, I’m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy. They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we’re going in, we’re not going in, the — you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn’t talk. We have to — you know, it’s sort like either do it or don’t do it. When I watch Dan Rather explaining how we are going to be attacking, where we’re going to attack, what routes we’re taking, what kind of planes we’re using, how to stop them, how to stop us, it is a little bit disconcerting. I’ve never seen this, where newscasters are telling you how — telling the enemy how we’re going about it, we have just found out this and that. It is ridiculous.
CAVUTO: Well, the problem right there.
TRUMP: Either you attack or you don’t attack.
CAVUTO: The problem there, Donald, is you’re watching Dan Rather. Maybe you should just be watching Fox.
TRUMP: Well, no, I watch Dan Rather, but not necessarily fondly. But I happened to see it the other night. And I must tell you it was rather amazing as they were explaining the different — I don’t know if it is fact or if it is fiction, but the concept of a newscaster talking about the routes is — just seems ridiculous. So the point is either you do it or you don’t do it, or you — but I just — or if you don’t do it, just don’t talk about it. When you do it, you start talking about it.
CAVUTO: So you’re saying the leash on this is getting kind of short here, that the president has got to do something presumably sooner rather than later and stringing this along could ultimately hurt us.
TRUMP: Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn’t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He’s under a lot of pressure. He’s — I think he’s doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.
Fox News interview with Neil Cavuto, 21 March 2003 (one day after the war began):
One day into the invasion of Iraq, Trump appeared again on Neil Cavuto’s Fox News program. He again did not criticize or condemn the war effort, calling it instead a “tremendous success”:
CAVUTO: What do you make of, just, how Wall Street’s been reacting to what our military guys have been doing?
TRUMP: Well, I think Wall Street’s waiting to see what happens but even before the fact they’re obviously taking it a little bit for granted and it looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint and I think this is really nothing compared to what you’re gonna see after the war is over. 
Esquire Magazine interview, August 2004 (18 months after the war began):
Here, finally, are Trump’s first published remarks critical of the Iraq War, which appeared almost a year and a half after the military action began. By then, this was not a particularly controversial stand to take:
Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we’re in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the county? C’mon. Two minutes after we leave, there’s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he’ll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn’t have.
What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who’ve been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!
The record shows that Donald Trump’s public stand against the Iraq War did not occur until August 2004, long after the war was underway, and only after he had on multiple previous occasions expressed either support for the war or non-committal opinions about its merits. The record does not support his contention that he was against the Iraq War “from the beginning.”",FALSE,2016-09-27
14,BETHANIA PALMA,"Did Donald Trump Say Not Paying Taxes ‘Makes Me Smart’?
","On 26 September 2016, presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump faced off for the first of three presidential debates at Hofstra University in New York. In the course of the debate, Clinton accused Trump of refusing to release his tax returns and suggested her opponent’s motivation was that he had something to hide:
CLINTON: For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing [returns] when you’re under audit.
So you’ve got to ask yourself, why won’t [Trump] release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he’s not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he’s not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don’t know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.
Or maybe he doesn’t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he’s paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody’s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn’t pay any federal income tax.
TRUMP: That makes me smart.

But when questioned by CNN’s Dana Bash immediately after the debate, Trump disclaimed that he said his paying no federal income taxes made him smart, quickly pivoting off the subject onto a complain about government spending:
DANA BASH: My question for you is, first of all, it sounds like you admitted that you hadn’t paid federal taxes and that, that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?
TRUMP: No, I didn’t say that at all. I mean if they say I didn’t, I mean it doesn’t matter. I will say this, I hate the way our government spends our taxes because they are wasting our money. They don’t know what they’re doing. They’re running it so poorly. Whether it’s spent in Iraq or wherever they’re spending it, they are wasting our money. So I do hate the way our government spends our money.


To hold that Trump hadn’t actually said what he had just been recorded saying would require a good deal of semantic contorting, such as claiming that Trump was describing his not releasing his tax returns (rather than his not paying tax) as “smart,” or that Trump meant he hadn’t said that he never paid any federal taxes (even if that was the case in at least some years).",TRUE,2016-09-28
15,DAN EVON,"Hillary Clinton Used Hand Signals to Rig Debate?
","Just when we thought we’d had our fill of debate-related conspiracies, a new one came along, this one in the form of a video purportedly documenting that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and moderator Lester Holt had colluded to rig the first presidential debate through a system of secret hand signals:
Scratching one’s face is one of the oldest signals in the book. You can be sure if this was a blackjack table and the house noticed a player making similar signals to a dealer they’d be investigated.


When the alt-right web site True Pundit shared the video, they did so along with the additional claim that Clinton had never made similar gestures in previous debates, campaign appearances, or speeches:
Before critics view this video and scream Conspiracy, True Pundit cross referenced Clinton’s speeches, campaign appearances and her 2008 debate performances against President Obama. According to that analysis, Clinton never previously used these hand motions to supposedly scratch her face. In fact, she rarely touches her face at all. (So, you haters can save the trouble of instructing people to remove their tin-foil hats.)
The above-displayed video does not provide any evidence that Hillary Clinton and Lester Holt communicated via hand signals so that Clinton could indicate to Holt when she wanted him to call on her so she could get in a “zinger.” The creator of the video simply strung together several unrelated events — Clinton scratching her face, Holt making a comment, Clinton replying to Trump — and then claimed that they were somehow connected to a furtive signaling plot without providing any proof.


But before we dig deeper into the video, let’s look at the accompanying claims about it from True Pundit and Infowars.
Hillary Clinton has been in the public eye for decades. She was the First Lady of Arkansas in 1983, the First Lady of the United States in 1993, a U.S. Senator in 2001, a presidential candidate in 2008, Secretary of State in 2009, and and a presidential candidate again in 2016. It is simply ridiculous to claim that Clinton never once touched her face during a speech, campaign rally, or debate: 

  It should be noted that Hillary Clinton was not the only one making these gestures during the first presidential debate:


It should also be noted that (as shown in the image at the head of this page) the two candidates were physically separated on the stage, and therefore in order to catch the supposed “signals” from Hillary Clinton, moderator Lester Holt — who didn’t have the advantage of the split-screen shot presented to television viewers — would had to have been rather obviously watching her even when she was not speaking.
If Donald Trump truly “dominated the early part of the debate” but then lost his advantage, the more logical explanation is that his opponent’s strategy to throw him off his game simply worked as expected:
The quiet Mr. Trump took the first shift, presenting a general-election version of his forceful campaign persona minus the bluster, insults and defenses of his anatomy. He pushed his case firmly, hitting his campaign’s focal points on the economy and trade.
But it didn’t take long for Mrs. Clinton to find the other Mr. Trump under that thin second skin. Her needling began immediately. She referred to her opponent as “Donald,” where he pointedly called her “Secretary Clinton.” (“Yes, is that O.K.?” he asked at his first reference to her.) She referred to his starting a business with a “$14 million” loan from his father, which Mr. Trump preferred to call a “very small loan.”
The digs targeted Mr. Trump’s status and founding mythos, triggering his image-protection reflex. He became combative and rattled, letting his opponent lead him down rhetorical detours (at one point he revived an old feud with Rosie O’Donnell) knowing that he would follow his ingrained ABCs: always be counterpunching.
It was Tony Soprano vs. Dr. Melfi, TV’s biggest antihero blustering against the woman who had gotten inside his head.
This conspiracy theory also doesn’t account for the much more obvious approach that if Hillary Clinton really wanted to say something during the course of the debate when it wasn’t her turn to speak, she could simply have interrupted her opponent rather than invoking secret hand signals and waiting to be called upon by the moderator — as she did in fact do multiple times … while Donald Trump also did so, but three times as often.",FALSE,2016-09-28
16,DAN EVON,"Lester Holt Wore an Earpiece During the Debate. So What?
","In the days following the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in 2016, a series of rumors and conspiracy theories were circulated in an attempt to somehow prove that the night had been rigged by the Democratic presidential nominee. After failing to provide evidence for any of these baseless claims — Hillary Clinton didn’t wear an earpiece, she didn’t communicate with moderator Lester Holt via secrethand signals, she wasn’t given the debate questionsweeks in advance — conspiracy theorist Alex Jones turned his sights on the moderator, claiming that Lester Holt broke the debate rules by wearing an earpiece:


Jones based his accusation on a clip of Holt sitting at the moderator’s desk and fiddling with something in his ear. The image of Holt glancing over his shoulder while sitting in an apparently empty room gave the appearance that the debate moderator was hiding something.
However, there was nothing to hide. Lester Holt clearly wore an earpiece during the presidential debate on 26 September 2016:


Holt’s wearing an earpiece during the debate did not break any rules set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Under the CPD’s guidelines, moderators are allowed to use earpieces so that they can be kept abreast of the time:
During primary debates (including the Democratic debate Holt moderated in January) TV producers can speak with the moderator through earpieces, proposing followup questions and supporting the host. Some production teams are more hands-on than others.
But it works differently at general election debates organized by the commission. The only person in Holt’s ear will be the commission’s longtime executive producer, Marty Slutsky, who has produced all of the debates since 2000.

17,DAVID EMERY,"Did Hillary Clinton Call the Trans-Pacific Partnership the ‘Gold Standard’ in Trade Agreements?
","Among the various accusations exchanged by the two candidates during the first presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump on 26 September 2016 was Trump’s assertion that Clinton lauded the multi-nation trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as the “gold standard” of such deals:
TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.
CLINTON: Well, that’s your opinion. That is your opinion.
TRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.
And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can’t win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.
CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in…
TRUMP: You called it the gold standard. You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it’s the finest deal you’ve ever seen.
CLINTON: No.
TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.
CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are — I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated…
TRUMP: Not.
CLINTON: … which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn’t. I wrote about that in my book…
What is the TTP? Sometimes described as a “much bigger version of NAFTA” (certain provisions are meant to be improvements on those of NAFTA and would supplant parts of it once TPP takes effect), the agreement covers 12 Asian-Pacific nations, including the U.S., Canada, and Mexico (but not China), drops tariffs, raises environmental protection and human rights standards, and is supported by the Obama administration. It has not yet been ratified by the United States.
As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton spoke favorably of the agreement-in-progress on several occasions. For example:
We want to realize the benefits from greater economic integration. In order to do that, we have to be willing to play. To this end, we are working to ratify a free trade agreement with South Korea, we’re pursuing a regional agreement with the nations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, andwe know that that will help create new jobs and opportunities here at home. (8 September 2010)


The United States is also making important progress on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will bring together nine APEC economies in a cutting-edge, next generation trade deal, one that aims to eliminate all trade tariffs by 2015 while improving supply change, saving energy, enhancing business practices both through information technology and green technologies. (9 March 2011)
This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world’s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment. (5 November 2012)
After leaving the State Department in 2013, however, Clinton’s remarks about the TPP became more guarded. “Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing,” she wrote in her 2014 book, Hard Choices, “it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement.” By the time of her October 2015 debate with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, Clinton was foursquare against it:
I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn’t meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, “This will help raise your wages.” And I concluded I could not.
Despite her current opposition to the agreement and her attempts during more than one presidential debate to recast her previous support of it as “hopeful,” the record shows that Clinton spoke glowingly of the TPP on more than one occasion, not least when she praised it in 2012 as setting “the gold standard in trade agreements.”",TRUE,2016-09-26
18,KIM LACAPRIA,"NAACP Said ‘Black Cops Aren’t Real Black People’
","On 27 September 2016 the clickbait site Downtrend published an article originally titled “NAACP SAYS BLACK COPS ARE NOT REAL BLACK PEOPLE,” asserting that:
One of the craziest things to come out of the Keith Scott shooting in Charleston, NC is the idea that it is racist for a black police officer to use deadly force on an armed black man. The NAACP, in its infinite wisdom, has come up with a foolproof way around this little problem. According to the organization, black cops are not real black people so therefore it is racist when they shoot actual black people.
“Many black people who become police officers become blue, not black. In order for you to survive in a police department, you take on the police department’s ideology, ways of life, and culture,” said an NAACP representative.
It doesn’t get any clearer than that. The NAACP is saying that becoming a police officer robs a black man of his black essence. That black cops are no longer truly black and must surrender their “black card” to the NAACP. In the context of the Keith Scott shooting, this statement also implies that black police officers are transformed into racist white killers of innocent black men.
This goes along with the popular black concept that articulate black people are “acting white,” or that responsible employed black people have sold out to the man. The NAACP is reinforcing the bullshit belief that the only way to be black is to be a jive-talking white-hating revolutionary scumbag.
Significant changes were made to the article between its original publication on 27 September 2016 and 30 September 2016. The revised version walked the claim back to being something supposedly stated by a “local NAACP” brand or chapter rather than the national NAACP organization:
A local branch of the NAACP, in its infinite wisdom, has come up with a foolproof way around this little problem. According to the organization, black cops are not real black people so therefore it is racist when they shoot actual black people.
The local NAACP is not convinced the Scott shooting was justified, despite multiple videos showing that he was armed. Even the facts that a gun was recovered from the scene and that Scott was illegally carrying a weapon when police shot him has done nothing to persuade them.
The article linked to news content published by Charlotte television station WCNC, which included video and transcribed comments from a Charlotte-Mecklenburg NAACP spokesperson:
Meanwhile, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg NAACP is calling for justice after Scott was shot and killed by a CMPD officer.
“Many black people who become police officers become blue, not black,” the local organization said. “In order for you to survive in a police department, you take on the police department’s ideology, ways of life, and culture.”


In other words, a single spokesperson for a local NAACP chapter (likely Charlotte branch president Corine Mack) suggested that many black cops have to subordinate their racial identities to police culture in order to work effectively as part of a police force, but no NAACP representative asserted that “black cops are not real black people.”",FALSE,2016-09-30
19,DAVID EMERY,Hillary Clinton Targets Family Farms with 65% Estate Tax?,"The social media post above stating that a so-called “65% death tax” proposed by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton would “take farms from families” echoes a claim made by Clinton’s GOP rival, Donald Trump, in a 28 September 2016 stump speech in Council Bluffs, Iowa:
By the way, for the family farmers, Hillary Clinton’s plan proposes an estate tax of 65 percent, 65 percent. So you are going to have an estate tax of up to 65 percent. Lots of luck having your kids hold on to your farms — not going to happen.
By way of comparison, Trump would repeal the estate tax altogether.
The “65%” figure cited in both instances comes from a set of tax reform proposals outlined on Clinton’s campaign web site covering topics ranging from closing tax loopholes to imposing a “risk fee” on the largest financial institutions to implementing the so-called “Buffet Rule” requiring millionaires pay at least a 30% effective tax rate. 
The basics of Clinton’s estate tax proposal are as follows:
Restoring fair taxation on multi-million dollar estates. Clinton is joining President Obama and other Democrats in calling for returning the Estate Tax to 2009 parameters, and lower the exemption for the Estate Tax from almost $11 million today, while raising the Estate Tax rate. And she will go further than that for estates valued in the tens and hundreds of millions, with higher rates as values rise, up to a 65% rate on estates valued at over $1 billion per couple. Hillary has called for Estate Tax reform for more than a decade, and embraced similar proposals in her 2008 presidential campaign. The Estate Tax only impacts the very largest estates, and the reformed Estate Tax would only affect the wealthiest 4 out of every 1,000 estates in the country. Her plan would also crack down on loopholes in the Estate Tax, including methods that people can now use to make their estates appear to be worth less than they really are.


As you can see, Clinton is indeed calling for a 65% tax rate, but this only applies to the largest estates — those valued at more than $1 billion per couple. That would probably include very few, if any, family farms.
That said, there’s more to Clinton’s proposal than slapping a 65% tax on the wealthiest estates. It would also lower the threshold for taxable estates from the existing $5.45 million in worth per individual ($10.9 million per couple) to $3.5 million per individual ($7 million per couple). It would raise the minimum tax rate on the smallest estates — currently at 40% — to 45%, and it would increase incrementally from there: 50% on the value of estates over $10 million ($20 million per couple), 55% on estates over $50 million ($100 million per couple), and, as already stated, 65% on estates over $500 million ($1 billion per couple).
This means that even though the “65%” figure people are raising alarms about probably wouldn’t affect family farms at all, other provisions in Clinton’s tax plan might. It would certainly be the case, for example, that inherited estates valued at between $7 million and $10 million per couple — which wouldn’t have been taxable before — would thereafter be taxed at the rate of 45 percent.
(A critical point to understand in calculating the effects of the estate tax is that it’s only levied on the portion of an estate’s value over a given threshold — e.g., an inherited estate valued at $8 million would be taxed at the 45% rate, but only on the value exceeding the $7 million threshold: $1 million. The first $7 million would not be subject to the tax.)

20,DAVID EMERY,Hillary Clinton Cut Her Tax Bill by ‘Donating’ $1 Million to Herself via the Clinton Foundation?,"An Internet meme circulating during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign purported to reveal financial trickery on the part of Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, who allegedly deducted $1 million from her 2015 income tax return after donating it “to herself” via contributions to the Clinton Foundation.
On the assumption that this information came from the candidate’s 2015 tax filing (released to the public earlier this year), that’s where we went to verify the accuracy of the claims. Our findings were these:
1. The return was a joint filing for both Hillary and William J. Clinton.
2. Their shared charitable donations totaled $1,042,000: $42,000 to Desert Classic Charities and $1 million to the Clinton Family Foundation.
3. Declaring an amount — say $1 million — as a charitable donation only reduces your taxable income; it doesn’t mean your “tax bill” is reduced by that amount.
4. The Clinton Family Foundation is a separate entity from the Clinton Foundation. Inside Philanthropy describes the Clinton Family Foundation as “a traditional private foundation that serves as the vehicle for the couple’s personal charitable giving.” It has neither staff nor offices. 
5. According to Inside Philanthropy, the Clinton Family Foundation regularly disburses contributions to scores of different charities (one of which is, in fact, the Clinton Foundation):
Digging into the Clinton Family Foundation’s 2014 tax return reveals that they did around $3.8 million in grantmaking and held some $5.3 million in assets. Of total grantmaking in 2014, $1.8 million went to the Clinton Foundation, just under half of total giving. 
However, in 2013, the Clintons gave $1.8 million through their personal foundation, with only around a fifth of that money going to the Clinton Foundation, around the same share as in 2012. 
So where have all the other gifts gone? To lots of different places, is the short answer. In 2014, the Clintons gave money to 70 nonprofits through their foundation. The picture looked similar the year before, with many grants falling in the range of $5,000 to $25,000.

21,DAN EVON,"Hillary Clinton Fundraiser Recording
","On 30 September 2016, various web sites published a leaked audio recording from a February 2016 fundraising event in Virginia at which Hillary Clinton made brief remarks before taking questions from the audience. One of those audience questions referenced the “cynicism” of some voters, to which Clinton responded by “examining the forces that leave many young voters disaffected” and analyzing why many of them supported the campaign of Bernie Sanders, a candidate whom Clinton felt offered a “false promise” to voters with concerns for their futures.
The audio clip was often shared under such misleading headlines claiming that Clinton had called millennial voters “basement dwellers.” The Week,  for instance, used the title “Hillary Clinton Calls Bernie Sanders Supporters Uninformed Basement Dwellers in Hacked Audio Clip.”
Although outlets such as The Week may have been attempting to paraphrase Clinton’s comments, the Democratic presidential nominee never actually used the phrase “basement dwellers.” Regardless, a rumor began circulating that Clinton had used that exact phrase, and soon enough the hashtag #basementdwellers (referencing something she didn’t say) was trending alongside #basketofdeplorables(referencing something she did say). 
However, Clinton never used the phrase “basement dwellers.” Rather, she expressed sympathy with young college-educated voters who had little choice but to remain at home due to being unable to find self-supporting jobs in the current market and had grown cynical of a system they felt had failed them:
Some are new to politics completely. They’re children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents’ basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don’t see much of a future. I met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said, “You know, none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college. And we don’t believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance.” So that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics. And so if you’re feeling like you’re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn’t pay a lot, and doesn’t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. So I think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be, you know, a wet blanket on idealism. We want people to be idealistic. We want them to set big goals. But to take what we can achieve now and try to present them as bigger goals.",Mostly False,2016-10-02
22,DAVID EMERY,Hillary Clinton Lost $6 Billion at the State Department?,"As the U.S. presidential campaign entered its home stretch on 1 October 2016, the New York Times released a partial income tax return for GOP candidate Donald Trump — the only tax information for Trump made public so far — showing that he deducted business losses in 1995 totaling $916 million.
The amount was so substantial, the Times‘ tax experts concluded, that it could have allowed Trump to “legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years,” a scenario not unlike one posited by Democratic contender Hillary Clinton during the first presidential debate days earlier:
So you’ve gotta ask yourself: Why won’t he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he’s not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he’s not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don’t know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn’t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he’s paid nothing in federal taxes.
The Trump tax revelations spurred Clinton to take up the cudgel yet again. “What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?” she said in a 3 October speech. “This is Trump to a tee. He’s taken corporate excess and made a business model out of it.”
To which Trump supporters responded by questioning the $6 billion in government funds Clinton reportedly “lost” when she was in charge of the U.S. State Department:
We’re not going to argue that the comparison isn’t valid — it is, in a sense — but it is our job to point out that the above wording misrepresents the facts. When Hillary Clinton’s State Department received an inspector general’s alert in 2014 charging that the paperwork on $6 billion in government contracts hadn’t been properly accounted for, it didn’t mean, despite some loosey-goosey media reporting at the time, that the money itself was “lost” or “missing.” State Department inspector general Steve Linick clarified what happened thusly:
The April 3 news article “State Department’s IG issues rare alert” reported on the management alert issued recently by my office. In the alert, we identified State Department contracts with a total value of more than $6 billion in which contract files were incomplete or could not be located. The Post stated, “The State Department’s inspector general has warned the department that $6 billion in contracting money over the past six years cannot be properly accounted for . . . . ”
Some have concluded based on this that $6 billion is missing. The alert, however, did not draw that conclusion. Instead, it found that the failure to adequately maintain contract files — documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of U.S. tax dollars — “creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department’s contract actions.”
Steve Linick, Washington
So, if the point of comparing Trump’s and Clinton’s “losses” is to imply that Clinton literally misplaced $6 billion in taxpayer monies, it fails. If the point, however, is that Clinton ought to be held responsible for mismanagement of the department’s record keeping practices such that $6 billion in government spending was  inadequately accounted for, it’s well taken.",Mostly False,2016-10-05
23,DAVID EMERY,Tim Kaine Fired 5 State Police Chaplains for Praying in Jesus’ Name?,"As you may have guessed from the example above, something happened in 2008 while Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine was Governor of Virginia having to do with police chaplains praying to Jesus and being out of a job. What news reportage from the time clearly shows, however, is that nobody got fired, and the governor had little, if anything, to do with what transpired.
This is how the incident was reported by the Washington Post on 25 September 2008:
Six Virginia State Police troopers have resigned their voluntary positions as chaplains following the implementation of a policy that bans them from referring to Jesus Christ in public prayers.
House Republicans blasted Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) for the directive, but Kaine’s office said the police superintendent issued the directive.
In a statement, Col. W. Steven Flaherty, the State Police superintendent, said he asked chaplains to offer nondenominational prayers at department-sanctioned public events but that the request does not apply to private ceremonies or individual counseling.
Flaherty said his decision was in response to a recent federal appeals court ruling that a Fredericksburg City Council member may not pray “in Jesus’s name” during council meetings because the opening invocation is government speech.
According to the Post and other sources, Kaine did not initiate the directive (although he did support the superintendent’s decision). And despite attempts by partisan media outlets to portray the troopers’ leaving their voluntary chaplain posts as “firings” or “forced resignations,” all six resigned by choice to protest the new rule.
“While the executive staff and Col. Flaherty are highly respected and provide great leadership,” one of the resigning chaplains, Trooper Rex Carter, told the Post, “this is just a policy several of us could not agree with when it comes to the issue of individual prayer.”
Contemporaneous news coverage by the Virginian-Pilot confirmed that the resignations were voluntary:
Col. W. Steven Flaherty, the State Police superintendent, earlier this month had instructed his department’s 17 chaplains to abide by a recent federal court decision upholding the constitutionality of nonsectarian prayers at government functions. At public functions, officers are permitted to use only nondenominational prayers.
In protest, six of the chaplains resigned those duties.
Flaherty cited the court decision — the case involved a challenge to a Fredericksburg City Council rule requiring nondenominational prayers prior to public meetings — in a written statement about the new policy.
“The department recognizes the importance as a state government agency to be inclusive and respectful of the varied ethnicities, cultures, and beliefs of our employees, their families and citizens at large,” Flaherty said in a statement.
It also noted that the restriction applies only to sanctioned government events, not private functions at which a chaplain is asked to preside.

","On 5 October 2016, Politico reported that presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had been edged out of the news cycle in the final weeks leading up to the November 2016 election by Hurricane Matthew, which (at the time the story was posted) was headed into Florida as a powerful Category 4 storm.
The story, citing an unnamed source “monitoring TV ad buys,” also reported that the Clinton campaign had spent $63,000 for ad time on the Weather Channel to coincide with the brunt of the hurricane’s hitting Florida.
The Politico piece dwelt chiefly on how the two candidates would grapple with being shouldered out of news coverage by Hurricane Matthew, and discussed the gamble Clinton was taking by buying ads during the storm, at the risk of being seen as “crass.” Opponents seized on the story to cast her in just that light.
After political blogs and commentators attacked Clinton for “capitalizing” on the pending disaster, the Clinton campaign released a statement to the media saying that the Weather Channel buy was a very small portion of their advertising outlay:
Earlier in the week, we made changes to our TV ad reservations across hundreds of stations in several battleground states including Florida. Less than 1% of those changes included The Weather Channel. We have requested that stations in Florida delay any of those ads on the Weather Channel until after the storm passes.
After Hurricane Matthew pummeled Haiti, Cuba, the Bahamas, and other Caribbean countries — leaving hundreds dead by even the most conservative estimates — the huge storm turned toward the southeastern United States, prompting the evacuations of millions of people living in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia as coastal regions flooded.",TRUE,2016-10-07

While several Republican politicians denounced the presidential candidate for these comments, some of Trump’s supporters attempted to point out the hypocrisy of this controversy by claiming that President Obama had once said something similar. 
The Trump supporter’s counter-claim involved a video seemingly showing President Obama demanding “ribs and pussy too” that was circulated on social media along with several false or misleading claims. For instance, it wasn’t a “breaking” or newly released video, and it didn’t capture Barack Obama “demanding” anything:


Although the clip is real, it doesn’t document an off-the-cuff remark made by President Obama demanding “ribs and pussy too.” Rather, this footage was taken from Barack Obama’s appearance on the show “The Author Series” on 20 September 1995 (long before he ran for the presidency) in which he read excerpts from his book Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance. The full clip shows that President Obama was describing a conversation he had with someone else about Malcolm X’s beliefs, and that the “ribs and pussy too” line was spoken by another character in the book.
You can watch the full episode below (the relevant segment starts at the 15:00 mark):

One of the guys sitting nearby must have overheard us because he leaned over with a sagacious expression on his face.

The quote was not uttered by Clinton during the any presidential debate. It does not appear in the transcript of the event, nor can Clinton be heard speaking this phrase during the broadcast.

Here’s Clinton’s actual response to a question about how she would select a Supreme Court justice, which is nothing like the questionable paraphrase offered by Raczkowski and shared by Hewitt:
QUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?
RADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.
Thank you. Well, you’re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.
Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn’t agree with that.
I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don’t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman’s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.
Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.
I want a Supreme Court that doesn’t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you’re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn’t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.
So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they’ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty.

","In October 2016, the WikiLeaks web site began publishing “The Podesta Emails,” an archive of e-correspondence to and from John Podesta, the chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Among the messages in that dump was an e-mail chain that purportedly revealed Hillary Clinton privately opposes same-sex marriage despite publicly embracing it in 2013: @HillaryClinton
Wikileaks exposed the fact that Hillary Clinton is STILL against gay marriage in private. Incredible.
— Jason (@EnemyWithinn) October 11, 2016

In a WikiLeaks-revealed chain of messages in which staffers addressed Hillary Clinton’s then-relatively recent reversal of position on LGBT rights, Clinton campaign operative Dan Scherwin stated the following:
I’m not saying double down or ever say [she opposed marriage equality] again. I’m just saying that she’s not going to want to say she was wrong about that, given she and her husband believe it and have repeated it many times. Better to reiterate evolution, opposition to DOMA when court considered it, and forward looking stance.


Viewed in isolation, the passage suggested Hillary Clinton (along with her husband Bill) “believe[d]” in opposing same-sex marriage. But the chain of e-mails was a long one, and the “believe” portion didn’t pertain to her core beliefs surrounding the same-sex marriage issue.
Earlier in the e-mail chain, Clinton campaign operatives quoted an extensive passage from a 2013 op-ed written by former President Bill Clinton on the subject of repealing the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Bill Clinton himself had signed the DOMA into law, an act he later justified (as expressed in the op-ed) as one necessary to head off efforts to pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage:
In 1996, I signed the Defense of Marriage Act. Although that was only 17 years ago, it was a very different time. In no state in the union was same-sex marriage recognized, much less available as a legal right, but some were moving in that direction. Washington, as a result, was swirling with all manner of possible responses, some quite draconian. As a bipartisan group of former senators stated in their March 1 amicus brief to the Supreme Court, many supporters of the bill known as DOMA believed that its passage “would defuse a movement to enact a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, which would have ended the debate for a generation or more.” It was under these circumstances that DOMA came to my desk, opposed by only 81 of the 535 members of Congress.
On March 27, DOMA will come before the Supreme Court, and the justices must decide whether it is consistent with the principles of a nation that honors freedom, equality and justice above all, and is therefore constitutional. As the president who signed the act into law, I have come to believe that DOMA is contrary to those principles and, in fact, incompatible with our Constitution.
When I signed the bill, I included a statement with the admonition that “enactment of this legislation should not, despite the fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surrounding it, be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination.” Reading those words today, I know now that, even worse than providing an excuse for discrimination, the law is itself discriminatory. It should be overturned.
Hillary Clinton herself said much the same thing about the necessity of her husband’s reluctantly signing the DOMA in order to prevent a less desirable outcome:
On Defense of Marriage [Act], I think what my husband believed — and there was certainly evidence to support it — is that there was enough political momentum to amend the Constitution of the United States of America, and that there had to be some way to stop that. And there wasn’t any rational argument — because I was in on some of those discussions, on both ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ and on DOMA, where both the president, his advisers and occasionally I would — you know, chime in and talk about, ‘You can’t be serious. You can’t be serious.’ But they were. And so, in a lot of ways, DOMA was a line that was drawn that was to prevent going further. It was a defensive action.
Thus Dan Scherwin’s writing about what “[Hillary Clinton] and her husband believe” “and have repeated … many times” is a reference to the Clintons’ subsequent claim that DOMA was a necessary evil to head off an in-progress effort to pass a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage. But as other staffers noted, the Clintons were wrong about that timing — the constitutional amendment issue didn’t arise until years after Bill Clinton signed the DOMA into law:
Since I was asked about the Defense of Marriage Act in an interview on MSNBC, I’ve checked with people who were involved then to make sure I had all my facts right. It turns out I was mistaken and the effort to pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage came some years later.

The most recent Blade article has Elizabeth Birch quoted as saying there was no amendment threat in 1996. Hilary Rosen has already tweeted the same. I’ll ask on the call, but my sense is that there aren’t many friends who will back us up on the point. That’s why I’m urging us to back off as much as we can there.
So, various staffers concluded, since Hillary Clinton was unlikely to either disavow or correct her (and her husband’s) claim that DOMA was needed to preclude the imminent passage of a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage (“she’s not going to want to say she was wrong about that given she and her husband believe it and have repeated it many times”), a better approach to would be to get her to talk about how her views on the same-sex marriage issue have changed over time, and how she supported efforts to have the DOMA declared unconstitutional (“better to reiterate evolution, opposition to DOMA when court considered it, and forward looking stance”)
My two cents is that you’re not going to get her to disavow her explanation about the constitutional amendment and this exercise will be most effective if it provides some context and then goes on offense.

I think we should pull her statements around the time she embraced marriage equality and place greatest emphasis on the fact that she fully acknowledges that she evolved.

I’m not saying double down or ever say it again. I’m just saying that she’s not going to want to say she was wrong about that, given she and her husband believe it and have repeated it many times. Better to reiterate evolution, opposition to DOMA when court considered it, and forward looking stance.
While it’s true Hillary Clinton didn’t publicly reverse her position on same-sex marriage until 2013, the “belief” questioned above was her assertion that DOMA was necessary to prevent a more restrictive constitutional amendment limiting same-sex marriage, not a belief in opposition to marriage equality. No part of the e-mail chain referenced here supports the notion that Hillary Clinton continued to privately oppose same-sex marriage despite her public-facing support for it.",FALSE,2016-10-11

","On 8 October 2016, a screenshot purportedly showing an e-mail sent by Hillary Clinton was circulated on social media along with the claim that the Democratic presidential candidate had used the term “sand n*gger” to describe Muslims.
The screenshot was real and the term “sand n*ggers” did appear in e-mail published by WikiLeaks. However, that e-mail did not capture Hillary Clinton herself using the derogatory term to refer to Muslims.
The screenshot shows an opinion piece written by Israeli author David Grossman that was published by Haaretz on 24 February 2012. The piece was later translated into English by Sol Salbe and later shared by Clinton via e-mail. Both Clinton’s e-mail and Salbe’s translation were preceded with a note from the translator:
Haaretz did something unusual: it placed an opinion piece on top of its front page.  But it wasn’t just  an ordinary opinion piece, it was written by one of the country foremost novelists, David Grossman. The article, like Emile Zola’s J’accuse, to which it has been compared, was a moral critique. Many who read it were very moved. But the moral missive never appeared in English (at least to my knowledge). The English Haaretz has always been somewhat reticent in presenting Israel to the world. And of course translating Grossman is not easy, he is a master of the language and the art of writing.I have no idea whether I have done justice to this work. But it needed to be translated. The message is too important.
It would also be incorrect to say that Grossman, the original author, used the term “sand n*gger” to refer to Muslims in general. Grossman’s piece described a series of events that led to a man being left to die on the side of the road, and the term “sand n*gger” was used to refer to how the stranded man, Omar Abu Jariban, may have been viewed by authorities:
I read in the newspaper that an argument ensued with the Israeli checkpoint commander, and that he refused to accept the patient. Did Omar hear the argument about him from within the van, or did they drag him out of the van and plonked  him in front of the commander, replete with catheter, nappy and hospital gown for a rapid overall assessment by the latter? And the commander said no. And yalla! We are on our way again. So they returned to van, and they kept on going. And now the guys in the van are perhaps not quite as nice before, because it is getting late and they want to get back and wonder what have they done to have deserved copping  this sand nigger and what are they going to do with him now.  If the Maccabim checkpoint rejected him, there was no way in which the Atarot checkpoint will take him. It is now pitch black outside and by the by, while traveling on Route 45, between the Ofer military base to the Atarot checkpoint, a thought or a suggestion pops up.  Perhaps someone said something and nobody argued against, or perhaps someone did argue back but the one who came up with the original suggestion carried more weight. Or perhaps there was no argument, someone said something and someone else felt that this is precisely what needs to be done, and one of them says to the driver, pull over for a moment, not here,  it’s too well lit, stop there. You, yes you, move it, get your arse into gear you piece of shit — thanks to you our van stinks;, you ruined our evening, get going! What do you mean to where?  Go there.
So while it’s true that the term “sand nigger” appeared in e-mail sent by Hillary Clinton, this term was not used by the former secretary of state to describe Muslims. Rather, it appeared in an opinion piece by an Israeli author about the death of a young man, which Clinton shared with others via e-mail.",Mostly False,2016-10-11

The image asks viewers to “share if you agree,” but its claims are not up for debate. They are false. 
First, the Hillary Clinton campaign has not spent “over $1 billion on negative Trump ads on TV.” Although Clinton has run a number of negative TV spots attacking her rival, she has not spent anywhere near $1 billion on such ads. Shortly after this image was published in September 2016, NBC partner Advertising Analytics released a report detailing how much money each of the candidates had spent on ads. They recorded that Clinton’s campaign spent about $90 million on ads during the general election (up to 20 September 2016), while pro-Clinton groups had spent an additional $60 million or so:
Hillary Clinton and her allies continue to dominate Donald Trump and pro-Trump outside groups in the 2016 advertising race. According to ad-spending data from NBC partner Advertising Analytics, Clinton’s campaign has spent $96.4 million in ads in the general election, versus $17.3 million for Trump’s campaign. That’s more than a 5-to-1 advantage for Clinton. And then when you factor in outside groups, it’s $156.6 million for Team Clinton, and $33.6 million for Team Trump. That’s almost a 5-to-1 advantage.


It’s also false to say that Clinton has never released a political ad touting her own accomplishments.

On 14 October 2016, posts went viral on Facebook and Twitter carrying the news that GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump had delivered $29,000 worth of emergency food and supplies to residents in Lumberton, NC and other nearby towns stricken by the hurricane:
Apart from the implication that Donald Trump himself was present for the deliveries (he wasn’t), the social media reports were accurate. Led by daughter-in-law (wife of Eric Trump) Lara, a Trump/Pence campaign offshoot called the Women’s Empowerment Tour spent two days delivering emergency supplies to Lumberton, Fayetteville, and Greenville, North Carolina in mid-October. Campaign spokesman Mark Serrano told the Fayetteville Observer that Donald Trump donated $29,000 worth of food and supplies for the effort.
The GOP nominee tweeted a short video about the hurricane relief mission on 14 October:
Lara Trump, a North Carolina native, credited the candidate with diverting her group from the campaign trail and sending them to the devastated region. She told the Fayetteville Observer:

","Did Donald Trump Jr Say ‘Women Who Can’t Handle Workplace Harassment Shouldn’t Work’?
","On 13 October 2016, the online news publication BuzzFeed posted a recording of comments made by Donald Trump, Jr. when he was a guest on the now-cancelled SiriusXM radio program The Opie & Anthony Show back in 2013. In the segment, Trump, the son of the 2016 Republican presidential nominee, complained about finding women in what had traditionally been a “guys’ place” and said that women who “can’t handle” workplace harassment “don’t belong in the workforce”:
Trump, along with hosts Gregg “Opie” Hughes and Anthony Cumia, were complaining about the presence of women who ruin their enjoyment of men’s environments by complaining about harassment. Trump said:
If you have a guys’ place, you have a guys place. I have a hard time letting go of that. Maybe I’m not gonna have a choice.
If you can’t handle some of the basic stuff that’s become a problem in the workforce today, then you don’t belong in the workforce. Like, you should go maybe teach kindergarten. I think it’s a respectable position.
A spokeswoman for SiriusXM has not responded to our inquiry to verify the recording, but the segment was also posted to YouTube on 1 March 2013. The hosts can be heard in the beginning of the 50-minute broadcast introducing Trump:

The discussion about women and harassment starts at about the 29-minute mark. The recording surfaced as Trump’s father was dealing with repercussions to his campaign after multiple women accused him of having groped them, allegations that began after a recording from 2005 was released in which Trump Sr. could be heard making lewd remarks about women and discussing touching them sexually without their consent.
Despite the pair’s large following, Anthony Cumia was fired from the The Opie & Anthony Show by SiriusXM in 2014 after he went on a racist Twitter rant following an altercation with an African-American woman.",TRUE,2016-10-17

",Are 16 States Using Voting Machines from a ‘Soros-Controlled Company’?,"With the advent of electronic voting systems — and public unease with casting ballots that are not tangible physical objects — every election cycle brings rumors that some individual or group with a heavy investment in the outcome of the election owns or controls the machines that record and count votes — and those parties will use their powers to “rig” the voting systems they control to ensure the election outcome conforms to their preferred results.
Billionaire business magnate George Soros was tagged in such rumors in 2012, and he was back in 2016 as the subject of articles by disreputable web sites such as the Daily Caller falsely claiming that Soros’ ties to the Smartmatic company, purportedly the manufacturer of voting machines used in 16 states, put him in a position to “rig” the election in Hillary Clinton’s favor:
HILLARY IS RIGGING THE ELECTION!
Surprised? You shouldn’t be.
We’ve just learned that Hillary is tied to the one company that has the power to sway this entire election – Smartmatic.
Smartmatic manufactures the voting machines that will be used this November.
The Chairman of Smartmatic, Mark Malloch-Brown, is on the board of George Soros’ Open Society Foundation.
Yes, George Soros, the billionaire CROOK who is one of Hillary’s biggest donors.
SMARTMATIC’S VOTING MACHINES WILL BE USED IN THESE 16 CRUCIAL STATES:
Arizona California Colorado District of Columbia Florida Illinois Louisiana Michigan Missouri New Jersey Nevada Oregon Pennsylvania Virginia Washington Wisconsin
HILLARY IS TRYING TO RIG THIS ELECTION BECAUSE SHE KNOWS IT’S THE ONLY CHANCE SHE HAS!
George Soros has no hand in the management or ownership of Smartmatic. As is typical of such claims, this one is based on nothing more than the most tenuous of connections — namely that among the number of non-profit boards on which Smartmatic Chairman Lord Mark Malloch-Brown sits is the Global Board of the Open Society Foundation, an international grantmaking network founded by George Soros. That fact that one of the many people on one of the many boards of one of the many organizations with which George Soros (a large Clinton donor) is involved also happens to chair an electronic voting company is taken as proof enough by conspirators that George Soros has the means, motive, and intent to commit a massive act of voting fraud. And, despite being the multinational billionaire business magnate that he is, Soros utterly lacks the common sense not to rig an election through a confederate so obviously connected to him.
As is also typical of such claims, those who propagate them mistakenly assume that every company in the business of providing electronic voting services is producing machines that record and count votes, which isn’t the case — such services can include anything from providing streamlined systems for reporting election results to the press to automating the process of voter authentication. It this case the assertion that “Smartmatic’s voting machines will be used in 16 crucial states” is a false one, apparently a misinterpretation of a statement on Smartmatic’s web site touting that the company had previously offered unspecified “technology and support services to the Electoral Commissions of 307 counties in 16 States” — a statement that didn’t say that Smartmatic supplied voting machines used in all if those states, or that Smartmatic was even currently working with any of those states in any capacity.


Indeed, the Case Studies section Smartmatic’s web site chronicles their primarily dealing in providing equipment and services for foreign elections — there’s no mention of Smartmatic’s being involved in U.S. elections beyond providing a voting system for a Utah state Republican caucus in March of 2016 and pilot testing an ePen for capturing provisional envelopes and vote-by-mail ballots in parts of Los Angeles County.
In fact, a search using Verified Voting shows that not a single one of the listed 16 states is using voting machines provided by Smartmatic in the upcoming election — Smartmatic isn’t even listed as a vendor of any voting machines being used in anystate.
Nonetheless, the false rumor has grown so prevalent that Smartmatic has addressedit themselves on their web site, in a page that includes a statement confirming that no Smartmatic technology is being used in any state during the 2016 U.S. presidential election:
• Smartmatic is 100% privately owned. Smartmatic has no ties to political parties or groups in any country and abide by a stringent code of ethics that forbids the company to ever donate to any political campaigns of any kind.
• The company’s headquarters were based in Florida for many years, but have since moved to London to service its global client base.
• George Soros does not have and has never had any ownership stake in Smartmatic.
• It is no secret that our Chairman Lord Mark Malloch-Brown is a member of a number of non-profit boards addressing global issues from poverty reduction to conflict resolution, including the Global Board of the Open Society Foundation. This is stated clearly in his official biography. Lord Malloch-Brown is a highly respected global figure whose credentials include former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations and former Vice-Chairman of the World Economic Forum. He also served in the British Cabinet, as Minister of State in the Foreign Office.
• Smartmatic will not be deploying its technology in any U.S. county for the upcoming 2016 U.S. Presidential elections.
• Our election technology has handled more than 3.7 billion votes over the past 12 years in election projects on five continents, without a single discrepancy.
• As a technology provider, Smartmatic is only responsible for, and concerned with, the technical aspects of the vote. Smartmatic does not comment on specific candidates or outcomes.
• Smartmatic’s voting technology has never been compromised. 
George Soros’ philanthropic organization comprises 22 different boards, but Smartmatic’s chairman sits on only one of them. Soros himself has never worked for, or held an ownership share in, Smartmatic.",FALSE,2016-10-20
35,KIM LACAPRIA,"Pope Forbids Catholics from Voting for Hillary Clinton
","On 20 October 2016, the web site Tell Me Now published a constitutionally misleading article reporting that Pope Benedict XVI forbade Catholics from voting for Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee:
Cardinal Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI in 2005 and served through 2013, wrote a blistering letter in 2004 forbidding Catholics from voting for pro-abortion Hillary Clinton or anyone who espouses her ideas.
The article was popular on social media, where users often share an article based on its headline alone. Although the headline specified Pope Benedict XVI (who resigned in early 2013), many readers inferred that a recent papal edict had been issued by Pope Francis (the current pope).

But the current Pope did not forbid anything of the sort, nor did the referenced 2004 letter from Cardinal Ratzinger (written prior to his elevation to papal status). Clinton was mentioned nowhere in that letter, which said the opposite of what the rumor claimed:
Presenting oneself to receive Holy Communion should be a conscious decision, based on a reasoned judgment regarding one’s worthiness to do so, according to the Church’s objective criteria, asking such questions as: “Am I in full communion with the Catholic Church? Am I guilty of grave sin? Have I incurred a penalty (e.g. excommunication, interdict) that forbids me to receive Holy Communion? Have I prepared myself by fasting for at least an hour?” The practice of indiscriminately presenting oneself to receive Holy Communion, merely as a consequence of being present at Mass, is an abuse that must be corrected (cf. Instruction “Redemptionis Sacramentum,” nos. 81, 83).
The Church teaches that abortion or euthanasia is a grave sin. The Encyclical Letter Evangelium vitae, with reference to judicial decisions or civil laws that authorize or promote abortion or euthanasia, states that there is a “grave and clear obligation to oppose them by conscientious objection. […] In the case of an intrinsically unjust law, such as a law permitting abortion or euthanasia, it is therefore never licit to obey it, or to ‘take part in a propaganda campaign in favour of such a law or vote for it’” (no. 73). Christians have a “grave obligation of conscience not to cooperate formally in practices which, even if permitted by civil legislation, are contrary to God’s law. Indeed, from the moral standpoint, it is never licit to cooperate formally in evil. […] This cooperation can never be justified either by invoking respect for the freedom of others or by appealing to the fact that civil law permits it or requires it”
[N.B. A Catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in evil, and so unworthy to present himself for Holy Communion, if he were to deliberately vote for a candidate precisely because of the candidate’s permissive stand on abortion and/or euthanasia. When a Catholic does not share a candidate’s stand in favour of abortion and/or euthanasia, but votes for that candidate for other reasons, it is considered remote material cooperation, which can be permitted in the presence of proportionate reasons.]
Cardinal Ratzinger wrote a letter (not an edict to all Catholics) in 2004 regarding ecumenical stances on politics. The letter in question pertained to worthiness to receive Holy Communion, not Hillary Clinton, and in the non-papal letter Cardinal Ratzinger asserted that although Catholics should be opposed to abortion and euthanasia, their voting for a candidate with differing stances on those issues “can be permitted in the presence of proportionate reasons” (i.e., if their support for that candidate is based on other issues).
Pope Francis himself has issued no letter or edict barring Catholics from voting for Hillary Clinton, and no command from the Vatican prevents American Catholics from freely choosing between candidates in the 2016 presidential election for fear of going against the Church. Pope Francis specifically declined to endorse either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, directing Catholics in October only to “[s]tudy the proposals well, pray, and choose in conscience.”
However, back in February 2016 the Pope described Trump’s proposals to deport more immigrants and force Mexico to pay for a wall along the border as “not Christian,” a statement he later tempered when pressed. Trump accused Pope Francis of making the remarks at the behest of Mexico, a comment that elicited laughter from the Pope:
Asked whether he would try to influence Catholics in how they vote in the presidential election, Francis said he “was not going to get involved in that” but then repeated his criticism of Mr. Trump, with a caveat.
“I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that,” Francis said. “We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.”
Asked about [Trump’s] comments, Francis laughed. “Thank God he said I was a politician because Aristotle defined the human person as ‘animal politicus,’ ” he said.
“So at least I am a human person,” the pope said. “As to whether I am a pawn, well, maybe, I don’t know. I’ll leave that up to your judgment and that of the people.”",FALSE,2016-10-21
36,DAN EVON,"Did Hillary Clinton Throw a Tantrum with Matt Lauer?
","Rumors holding that Hillary Clinton had a “meltdown,” threw a water glass at a staffer, and engaged in a curse-filled tirade following NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum with host Matt Lauer have been circulating since the Democratic presidential nominee participated in that forum, which aired on 7 September 2016. While these rumors did seem to be rooted in a little truth — the Clinton campaign was not happy with the questions Lauer asked (or didn’t ask) during the event — claims that Clinton threw a “hissy fit” over it were unfounded.

The website Victurus Libertas was the first to promulgate this rumor, publishing an article headlined “Temper! Temper! Hillary Goes on Rampage for Over An Hour — Throwing Glass at Staffer’s Head.” Although Victurus Libertas linked to credible reports from NY Mag  and Yahoo! News detailing that Clinton’s campaign was miffed with Lauer for not fact-checking Republican candidate Donald Trump during the event, they cited Politico as their source for the claim that Clinton had thrown a water glass at a staffer:
And Politico‘s headlines read:  “Liberals Lash Out at Lauer, NBC“. It seems to me, no one is “lashing out” but Hillary.
Hillary’s meltdown included throwing a water glass at a staffer — narrowly missing her head, and demanding Matt Lauer be fired! She was overheard threatening executives at NBC saying “If I lose, we all go down and that Fascist Fuck will have us swinging from nooses! What the fuck is wrong with you idiots?”


None of this information appeared in the cited Politico report, however.
Politico published an article headlined “Liberals Lash Out at Lauer, NBC,” reporting that Clinton’s campaign and supporters were upset with interviewer Lauer for posing “unbalanced questions”:
At an event that saw both Clinton and conservative challenger Donald Trump challenged on their stances toward national defense and foreign policy, liberal operatives and Clinton supporters took exception to what they perceived as unbalanced questions, criticizing Lauer for failing to push back on false statements by Trump and for spending a significant amount of time on Clinton’s email scandal.
But Politico did not report that Hillary Clinton threw a water glass at anyone’s head, threatened the firing of Matt Lauer, or called Donald Trump a “fascist fuck.” All of that was invented by Victurus Libertas in an apparent attempt to smear the Democratic candidate, and it served as the basis for a longer, highly embellished version of the rumor that began circulating via e-mail in October 2016:
Subject: Matt Lauer & Hillary what REALLY happened….
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AT THE NBC PRESIDENTIAL FORUM WITH MATT LAUER?
DEMOCRAT HILLARY CLINTON’S BEHIND THE SCENES TIRADE AFTER NBC’s MATT LAUER ASKED CLINTON ONE QUESTION SHE HAD NOT PRE-APPROVED.
VETERAN NBC CAMERAMAN: ‘YOU REALLY HAD TO SEE THIS TO BELIEVE IT … SHE CAME APART – LITERALLY UNGLUED; SHE IS THE MOST FOUL-MOUTHED WOMAN I’VE EVER HEARD … AND THAT VOICE AT SCREECH LEVEL … AWFUL!’
“SHE LOOKED SO ENRAGED THAT WE ALL THOUGHT HER HEAD WOULD EXPLODE … IT WAS A FULL-ON MELT-DOWN, AND THEN SHE SCREAMED SHE’D GET THAT F–––ING LAUER FIRED FOR THIS. IT WENT ON FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOUR; WE ALL THOUGHT THE EMS WOULD BE THE NEXT CALL.”
NBC Associate Producer of Forum:
Behind the scenes, NBC technicians and cameramen at the Wednesday night, Commander-in-Chief Forum (Sept 7) report that Hillary Clinton was so angry and incensed that she had been ‘blind-sided’ by one question she was not prepared for and had not approved in advance.
“When her time in front of the cameras ended, Clinton shook the hand Lauer extended to her and smiled once more for the wide camera shot and then Hillary proceeded to pick up a full glass of water and threw it at the face of her assistant and the screaming started. She was in a full meltdown and no one on her staff dared speak with her — she went kind of manic and didn’t have any control over herself at that point. How these people work with this woman is amazing to me. Most of the small military audience were cordoned off, their seating not close to Mrs. Clinton, but certainly they heard her screaming because it was loud … and she really didn’t seem to care who heard any of it.”
Republican Donald Trump also appeared, in a separate telecast from Hillary Clinton’s and arrived with his two sons but no entourage or assistants in tow. The NBC cameramen involved in his segment said he was a ‘true gentleman’ and Trump and his sons spoke to everyone and thanked them for inviting him to speak: “It was a pleasure to answer your questions Matt.”
Hillary Clinton’s segment was much different. According to people working on the sidelines, “When Matt posed the one legitimate question about the FBI investigation concerning her homemade server and the unsecured emails, we could see she was beginning to boil and her eyes looked to pop.”
“It was toward the end of her interview so she was becoming unglued by the time Lauer finished with questioning. Hillary went ballistic, throwing a huge tantrum and screaming at her staff, “you f–––ing idiots, you were supposed to have this thing set up for me and you’ve screwed it up! If that fucking bastard wins we all hang from nooses! Lauer’s finished … and if I lose it’s all on you ass—-s for screwing this up.”
Clinton finally stormed off the military ‘set’ and the assistant producer said she was screaming that she wanted to talk to “the idiot who set this mess up … you do not blindside me – ever!” and continued to demand to speak with executives at Comcast, parent company to NBC Universal.
Her dozen or more aides were visibly disturbed and tried to calm her down when she started shaking uncontrollably. That did not stop her from demanding an executive “on the phone, now!” She was told the executive-in-charge of the forum was ready to talk with her and she was led away by two rather large aides who appeared to help her walk.
The TV executives got the message with all of the censuring headlines that followed over the next couple of days when it seemed the entire media turned on Matt Lauer for behaving in a “partisan” manner and “being grossly unfair and critical of the former secretary of state.”
Matt Lauer was heavily criticized on air by the Clinton campaign the rest of the week with most of the mainstream media joining in. The media appeared to frame Matt’s one serious question as the Clinton campaign was doing…”an unfair and partisan attack on Mrs. Clinton.”
Matt Lauer is still facing major backlash following his 23 minutes with Hillary Clinton. Privately, many reporters said Matt handed the Democrat nominee the expected softball questions, but made the decision to ask about the emails because, “the American people deserve an answer from the former secretary of state.”
Calls were made to New York Times, Washington Post and Huffington Post and Twitter executives with orders to “Crush Matt Lauer”. As you can easily see with all the headlines from these MSM sources, they did as they were told by the Clinton campaign.
Hillary also screamed that she would be “treated with respect at the debates or heads will roll.” Staffers at the Clinton campaign report that they fear her wrath and uncontrollable outbursts, and one described Hillary as “an egotistical psychopath”.
Since Hillary does not allow any staff to have cell phones when she is in their presence, no footage is available, but Hillary will never let this rest. She has made it clear that she wants Matt Lauer to be “persona non grata – for putting her on the spot.”
Interim DNC chairman Donna Brazile, the first black woman to hold the position, was singled out by Hillary during the rant.   She screamed at Donna, “I’m so sick of your face. You stare at the wall like a brain dead buffalo, while letting that f–––ing Lauer get away with this. What are you good for, really? Get the f––– to work janitoring this mess — do I make myself clear?”
A female NBC executive said that Donna Brazile looked at Mrs. Clinton and never flinched, which seemed to enrage Hillary all the more.  The executive continued, “It was the most awful and terrible…and racist display — such a profane meltdown I have ever witnessed from anyone, and I will never forget it. That woman should never see the inside of the oval office I can tell you that. She was unhinged and just continued to verbally abuse everyone — she was out of control.”
The earliest iteration of that longer narrative we could uncover was posted to the message board of the web site MTStars, where it was presented without citations, source information, audio, video, or any other documentation that the described these events actually transpired. It should also be noted that no credible news outlets reported that Clinton went on a cursed-filled tirade after the Commander-in-Chief Forum, or that she threw a water glass at a staffer’s head.
Rumors that Clinton threw a “tantrum” after NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum started with a fictitious quote, and that narrative was later expanded with more fake quotes from other anonymous sources. Meanwhile, no actual evidence has surfaced to prove that any of these events actually transpired.",FALSE,2016-10-22
37,DAVID EMERYBROOKE BINKOWSKI,"Did Donald Trump Transport Stranded Troops on His Own Airplane?
","In May 2016, syndicated talk radio host Sean Hannity aired an item claiming that Donald Trump had sent a plane to give 200 stranded U.S. marines a much-needed ride home after Operation Desert Storm in 1991:
When Corporal Ryan Stickney and 200 of his fellow Marines prepared to return to their families after Operation Desert Storm in 1991, a logistics error forced them to turn to a surprising source for a ride home: Donald J. Trump.
Today, Stickney would like to say “thank you.”
Stickney (left), was a squad leader in a TOW company of a Marine reserve unit based in Miami, FL and spent approximately six months in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War between 1990 and 1991.
Upon his unit’s return to the United States, the former Marine says the group spent several weeks decompressing at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before heading back to Miami.
Stickney recalls being told that a mistake had been made within the logistics unit and that an aircraft wasn’t available to take the Marines home on their scheduled departure date.
This — according to Stickney — is where Donald Trump comes in.
“The way the story was told to us was that Mr. Trump found out about it and sent the airline down to take care of us. And that’s all we knew … I remember asking ‘Who is Donald Trump?’ I truly didn’t know anything about him,” the former Marine said.
Corporal Stickney snapped a photo to remember the day by:

The story came up several times during the course of the 2016 presidential campaign (Cpl. Stickney even told it in person at a Trump rally), but skeptics questioned its validity despite a statement from the Trump campaign allegedly confirming it: “The Trump campaign has confirmed to Hannity.com that Mr. Trump did indeed send his plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami, Florida to transport over 200 Gulf War Marines back home. No further details were provided.”
The few details we do have about Trump’s alleged participation don’t, in fact, add up.
We can confirm, based on military records, that the 209-member Anti-Tank (TOW) Company, part of the 8th Tank Battalion for Operation Desert Shield, deployed to Camp LeJeune, North Carolina, from their home base in Miami on 26 November 1990. And we can confirm that the company deployed from Camp LeJeune to Saudi Arabia on 22 December, served throughout the combat phase of Operation Desert Storm (from 17 January to 28 February 1991), and returned to North Carolina in April. A command chronology of the deployment notes that a “Cpl. Stickey” was among those receiving certificates of commendation.


We can also confirm, via a 23 April 1991 article from the Sun-Sentinel, that a series of flight delays stalled the company’s homecoming to Miami on 22 April, but that they finally did arrive home after split across two separate flights. Stickney’s photograph shows that he arrived on a plane marked “Trump,” but it also proves something else: that even if Trump did send the plane, it wasn’t his private jet.
That Trump didn’t send the pictured plane at all was something noted by a sharp-eyed reader, who wrote to us to note:
First, that’s not Trump’s private 727 jet; it’s one of the jets in the Trump Shuttle fleet. I wondered if maybe Trump’s jet back in those days was painted differently, so I researched his private jet as of April 1991. I found that Trump was deep in the red, financially, and having to liquidate assets, one of which was his personal 727. The sale of that jet was finalized in the first week of May 1991, making it highly unlikely he was also flying reservists around while discussing the sale at the end of April.
The markings of the plane in Stickney’s photo match those of the Trump Shuttle fleet, so the question becomes: Did Trump himself send a Trump Shuttle to retrieve the stranded Marines, or was it procured some other way?
To arrive at an answer, it’s necessary to go into a bit of the history of Trump Shuttle. A July 2015 article in NYC Aviation detailed Trump’s short-lived airline industry involvement, beginning with an entirely separate carrier, Eastern Air Shuttle, which he immediately rebranded with his own name:
CEO Frank Lorenzo … began selling off assets including the prized Shuttle operation. Donald Trump placed a winning bid for the Shuttle, its aircraft and landing slots at LaGuardia and National for $380 million dollars that was financed through no less than 22 banks. The newly branded Trump Shuttle took the skies on June 7, 1989.
Timing is everything in business, and unfortunately for Trump he entered the airline game at the wrong time. The US entered an economic recession in the late-‘80’s leading many corporations to cut back on business travel. In addition, tensions in the Middle East leading up to the first Gulf war caused oil prices to spike. This 1-2 punch was devastating for the airline industry and led to the demise of a number of airlines including Eastern and Pan Am. Given these circumstances, the Trump Shuttle lost money, and with Trump continuing to accumulate debt in his other ventures it was becoming increasingly difficult to pay back the loans taken to purchase the airline. In September of 1990 Trump defaulted on his loan and control of the airline went back to the banks led by Citibank.
Given that the bankers, not Donald Trump, owned Trump Shuttle from September 1990 until it was sold to U.S. Air in 1996, Trump wasn’t in a position to send the planes anywhere, much less on a spur-of-the-moment Marine transport mission. So who did? As it turns out, the U.S. military itself chartered the flights — a common practice in the day, according to an 11 August 2016 report by The Washington Post:
Lt. Gen. Vernon J. Kondra, now retired, was in charge of all military airlift operations. He said that relying on commercial carriers freed up the military cargo aircraft for equipment transport.
Kondra’s notes on the flight are declassified and available online and show a contract for Trump Shuttle to “move troops in [the] continental United States” during the 1990-91 timeframe:
There are several references to a 1990-91 contract for Trump Shuttle to carry personnel across the United States, between the East and West Coasts, on a standard LaGuardia-Dover-Charleston-Travis-Chord-Kelly-Dover-LaGuardia run.
“It worked very well, and the crews loved it, and really thought that we’d done something special for them,” Kondra recalled in the oral history. “It was a helluva lot better than using 141s [cargo craft], which we could use for something else.”
But Kondra said that the notion that Trump personally arranged to help the stranded soldiers made little sense. “I certainly was not aware of that. It does not sound reasonable that it would happen like that. It would not fit in with how we did business. I don’t even know of how he would have known there was a need.” 
So the real story underlying the claim that Donald Trump personally sent his jet to pick up stranded soldiers and return them to the U.S. is that the military paid to charter a plane from an airline Trump no longer owned in order to bring those service personnel home.",FALSE,2016-10-22
38,DAN EVON,"Hillary Clinton: ‘I Will Get the NRA Shut Down for Good’
","On 25 October 2015, a Tumblr page dedicated to dubious Hillary Clinton quotes posted an image of the Democratic presidential candidate along with a quote supposedly uttered by her during an interview with the Des Moines Register on 8 August 2015 about her vowing to shut down the NRA and ban handguns if she were elected President:

The “Shocking Hillary Clinton Quotes …” Tumblr page claims that all of their quotes are 100% sourced and even provides links to make it appear as if the quotes have been verified:
Get to know the psychopath known as Hillary Clinton a little better.
These are 100% sourced and verified quotes. We recommend you SHARE and SPREAD these far and wide, to friends and family.
But the link included with the above-displayed meme didn’t lead to a page containing Clinton’s purported quote; it just pointed to the Des Moines Register‘s main page. Additionally, a search of the Des Moines Register‘s archives yielded no results for the phrase in question (on 8 August 2015 or any other date).


Hillary Clinton did campaign in Iowa in the summer and fall of 2015, and she was interviewed by the Des Moines Register more than once during that period. But she wasn’t in Iowa on 8 August 2015, she wasn’t interviewed by the Register on that date, nor was she quoted in the Register on that date.
On 14 July 2015, the Register quoted Clinton on the subject of guns as follows:
“I’m going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because I believe we can do better than that,” she said. “A majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners agree with universal background checks to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people who are mentally unstable and even terrorists.” 
On 26 August 2015, the Register quoted Clinton on the subject of guns as follows:
In answering questions about the murder of a TV reporter and cameraman in Virginia, Clinton said she was deeply saddened, but added that their deaths need to spark action to restrict access to handguns.
“We’ve got to do something,” she said. “It’s a very difficult political issue. But we are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer … we will not see more needless, senseless deaths.” 
And on 6 October 2015, the Register quoted Clinton on the subject of guns as follows:
Most Americans, including most gun owners, would support reasonable limits on guns to help stop massacres like the one in Oregon, Hillary Clinton told Iowans.
“I’m tired of people in public life saying, ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with families whose children are murdered at community colleges or elementary schools or people killed at Bible studies or going to the movies,’” the Democratic presidential candidate said. “We can’t tolerate that. This doesn’t just happen … We let it happen.”
Her audience at Davenport’s RiverCenter applauded as Clinton vowed to make it harder for people who shouldn’t have guns to obtain them. Among other things, she favors broader background checks, including sales at gun shows, and stronger measures to prevent gun purchases by domestic abusers or people with serious mental health problems.
“We keep getting stymied because of the lobby for a very small minority of gun owners and the gun manufacturers, which stand in the way,” she said.
Clinton has spoken throughout the campaign about her intention to implement tighter gun rules, despite pressure from the National Rifle Association. This week, she released specifics of her proposals.
“I feel like this is unfinished business in our country, and I am very determined that we are going to try to bring some sanity back, so that people’s Second Amendment rights are protected — but they are not absolute, the way the NRA wants them to be. There are common-sense ways to make sure people are not using guns to commit mass murders.” 
In short, Hillary Clinton spoke of wanting to implement broader, universal background checks for gun purchasers to keep firearms away from domestic abusers and people with serious mental health problems, but not of shutting down the NRA or banning handguns entirely. “I will get the NRA shut down if I become president. If we can ban handguns we will do it.” is a completely fabricated quote that was not spoken by Hillary Clinton (or anyone else) and did not appear in the Des Moines Register (or any other source) on 8 August 2015 (or any other date).",FALSE,2016-10-22

The “idiot soldiers” e-mail was not the first time falsified documents were passed off as authentic leaked e-mails. A Newsweek misinterpretation of WikiLeaks’ releases led to claims the leaks were fabricated, faked e-mail screenshots suggested Clinton called supporters of Bernie Sanders a “bucket of losers” and swing state voters “white trash,” and legitimate e-mails mocking a conspiracy theory about Clinton being involved in a plane crash were reframed as a “shocking leak.”",FALSE,2016-10-24
40,BETHANIA PALMA,Hillary Clinton’s ‘Sudden Move’ of $1.8 Billion to Qatar Central Bank Stuns Financial World,"On 16 October 2016, the conspiracy-mongering fake new sites WhatDoesItMean.com, posted a story reporting that Hillary Clinton (or the Clinton Foundation, depending on whether one read the headline or the first paragraph) suddenly transferred $1.8 billion to the Qatar Central Bank. The story, posted by a blogger who uses the nom de plume Sorcha Faal, claimed the transfer was exposed by a report circulating in the Kremlin:
An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were “stunned/bewildered” a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the “facilitation/abetment” of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM) — and for reasons yet to be firmly established.
According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world’s oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their “bank of banks”; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest “megabank”; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia.
The article linked to a number of news sites and blogs but conveniently failed to link to the alleged Kremlin report that would support its main claim. The lack of proof that such a financial transfer was made hasn’t stopped other unscrupulous web sites, such MegynKelly.org (which despite using her name doesn’t have anything to do with the Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly) and Liberty Alliance from posting the story as though it were a legitimate news item.
RationalWiki describes Sorcha Faal’s blog as an “eyesore” that is taken seriously only by its conspiracy theorist audience, and even then only marginally:
Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of “reports” published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don’t think much of it.
Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don’t contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish.
As we have noted in the past, Sorcha Faal is a notorious poster of false information, but the Internet being what it is, such information gets picked up and spread by unwary readers.

Russia and the United States have never been allies. One easily remembers how tense and long-lasting the Cold War was, and it left Russia very angry that they suffered such a demoralizing defeat as a world power.
While the United States should not become Vladimir Putin’s best friend, we also have to realize that Russia is a super power in this world and we must take them seriously.

But now, As of Sunday, October 23, Putin has ordered the Russian Defense Ministry to begin training and managing all local authorities, law enforcement, and state security as they are preparing for a nuclear war with the United States.

The article is rife with factual inaccuracies and baseless claims (not to mention misspellings). In fact, the credibility of this article is in question from the first sentence, when it states that the two countries were “never allies.”  In actuality, the United States and the Soviet Union worked together during World War II.  The article also claimed that Russia was stationing “dozens of large aircraft carriers” near Syria; Russia only has a single aircraft carrier.  
While Conservative Daily Post linked to several legitimate news articles about the rising tensions between Russia and the United States, none of them provided any evidence that Putin had given Obama and Clinton an ultimatum to stop “smearing” Russia, gave any information about where and when Putin issued the threat, or explained how the United States could possibly comply.

42,BETHANIA PALMA,"6,000 Muslims with Forged Papers Caught at Southern Border","On 24 October 2016, the Conservative Daily Post published a badly-jumbled article that was a mish-mash of information gleaned from other conservative publications, which themselves rehashed a legitimate 16 August 2016 news report about cross-Mexico migration by people from outside the continental Americas:
An official report was released on Monday, stating that 6,342 “Special Interest Aliens” have been captured. This report shows just how bad it has gotten at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency recently endorsed Donald Trump, and now we know why.
Federal U.S. Agents working on the border in immigration facilities have detained over 6,000 Islamic aliens. Conservative Tribune confirmed this in a recent report on the state of our crumbling borders.
Adam Isacson, An analyst at the Washington Office in Latin America pointed out the specific location the jihadists where able to enter from. The Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged this glaringly weak area of Tapachula in the past, yet has failed to take any real action. It is an area that terrorist groups could easily use to funnel in weapons, ammunition, drugs, and sex slaves.
For starters, Tapachula lies on Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala, not on the U.S.-Mexico border. Further, there is no “official report” or credible media report that 6,000 “Islamic aliens” have been detained by U.S. agents. The information was apparently gleaned from conservative web sites such as Breitbart and the Conservative Tribune, both of which used misleading headlines (Breitbart: “Thousands of Middle Eastern Illegal Immigrants Busted With Forged Papers at Border; Conservative Tribune: “6,000 Muslims Cross Southern Border, All Caught With 1 Alarming Item). Both publications cribbed their stories from a report by Reuters that did not report what those sites claimed.
According to Reuters, U.S. agents had been sent to Mexico’s southern border to vet 640 migrants from countries outside the Americas who were being held there. Further, Reuters reported that 6,342 migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East were apprehended by Mexican authorities trying to enter that country in the first six months of 2016.The figures were accompanied by a similar growth in migrants from outside the American continent attempting to enter the U.S. along its Southwest border, but the report made no mention of the migrants’ religion nor stated that they were all using forged papers:
The U.S. agents’ findings come as Mexican immigration data show 6,342 Asian, African and Middle Eastern migrants were apprehended trying to enter Mexico in the first six months of this year. That was up from 4,261 in all of 2015, and 1,831 in 2014.
U.S. border apprehensions point to the same trend. Between October 2015 and May 2016, U.S. agents apprehended 5,350 African and Asian migrants at the U.S. Southwest border. That’s up from 6,126 in all of fiscal year 2015 and 4,172 in all of fiscal year 2014.
U.S. concerns about potential security risks from migrants using the unusual and circuitous southern route have been growing in recent years, following a string of Islamic State-inspired attacks in the West and the surge in Syrian refugees fleeing that country’s civil war.
Five Syrian nationals detained in Honduras last November were part of a wider group of seven Syrians who acquired forged passports in Brazil and then went by land to Argentina on their way north, a U.S. government source familiar with that case said. There was no evidence to suggest the men were militants.
While the Reuters report does make it clear that upticks in migrants making arduous treks through Latin America and Mexico in order to enter the United States (sometimes with forged documents) presents a security concern, most of those migrants are persons seeking better economic prospects or fleeing persecution, not “jihadists” intent on wreaking terror in America. U.S. agents are making efforts to partner with immigration authorities in other countries to gain intelligence on who may be heading north to America’s southern border with Mexico.
The web sites mentioned above published fear-mongering headlines about “thousands” of Muslim migrants converging on the U.S.-Mexico border, but the Reuters report specifically identified only about a dozen people hailing from predominantly Muslim countries trying to migrate to the United States through Mexico. None of those persons were tied in the Reuters report with any type of terrorist activity. It’s also worth noting that while the union that represents employees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) endorsed Trump, the agency itself has made no political endorsement, as no governmental agency would.",Mostly False,2016-10-24

The entirety of Gateway Pundit article, reproduced above (with the exception of a video in which Donald Trump tells Hillary Clinton that she would be in jail if he were President), consisted of a catchy title, a baseless claim, and a screenshot of Mook’s Twitter page. Gateway Pundit did not point to a single tweet that Mook had purportedly deleted or provide any evidence that his Twitter account was altered after the FBI’s announcement. 
The Gateway Pundit deleted their article shortly after publication (most likely because it was not backed up by any factual evidence) but, rumors continued to circulate that Mook had deleted his Twitter feed:

Robby Mook did not delete his Twitter feed because he was “spooked” about a potential FBI investigation into Clinton’s campaign servers. Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, joined Twitter in April 2015 but didn’t post anything to the service until 26 October 2016.

It should also be noted while the FBI’s announcement in October 2016 may have been surprising to the Clinton campaign, controversy over the candidate’s e-mail server was not. The investigation into Clinton’s e-mails started in 2014, before Mook created his Twitter account and was a major focus throughout the 2016 Presidential election.

There is no location identified in the video, but it makes reference to the man’s boarding care facility, saying that “if [Clinton is] president,” he would receive forms for him to sign to get the alleged payment:

The video was also posted on YouTube, but without any additional information. A thread on Reddit claimed that it was filmed at a facility in California, but that has not been confirmed, and one version of the claim attributes it to Buzzfeed without offering any proof.

","On 31 October 2016, the blog Bipartisan Report posted a story entitled “BREAKING: ABC Uncovers MILLIONS Of Payments From Russia To Trump, Campaign Panics.” Hours later, Occupy Democrats posted a similar story:
Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.
Both posts were referencing a report that was, by then, more than a month old. A 22 September 2016 story from ABC News does say Trump has business investments in Russia, but it does not say that Trump is being paid millions by the Russian government, which might be inferred by the headlines on the above posts:
As questions have been raised about Trump’s business interests with Russians, the candidate has sought to distance himself from Moscow.
“For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia,” he wrote on Twitter in July.
He later told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, “Will I sell condos to Russians on occasion? Probably. I mean I do that. I have a lot of condos. I do that. But I have no relationship to Russia whatsoever.”
But an ABC News investigation found he has numerous connections to Russian interests both in the U.S. and abroad.
“The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen,” said Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group and who says he once helped market Trump’s U.S. condos in Russia and the former Soviet states. “They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump.”
Trump’s relations with Russia and that country’s president, Vladimir Putin, have been the source of intrigue and consternation through the course of the 2016 election cycle. But while the report pointed to Trump’s dealings with Russian businessmen, it does not claim that government officials are funneling him money.  Instead, it raises concerns that Trump will be swayed as president by his financial interests in Russia to the detriment of U.S. foreign policy — namely, lifting sanctions to ease the flow of money:
But [Florida broker Daniel] Pansky and [New York real estate agent Victoria] Shtainer told ABC News that purchases from Russian buyers in New York and Miami began to drop precipitously in 2014, when the U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to the Russian military incursion into Crimea.
To Russian buyers looking to move money out of their home country, Shtainer explained, the sanctions “basically cut off their oxygen.”
Should Trump come out on top in the elections in November, he has said he’ll consider whether or not to lift sanctions on Russia.
“We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking,” Trump responded in July when asked if he would roll sanctions back.
While Trump has expressed an affinity for Putin, no evidence of a direct monetary link between Trump and the Kremlin has been presented. The question raised by the ABC report was the possibility that Trump might use the office of president to benefit his own finances, while the blog posts asserted that Trump’s relationship with Russia had less to do with business than with cozying up to the Kremlin — a claim that was not made by the original source of the story.",Mostly False,2016-10-31

It’s official. NBC is now reporting that Donald Trump’s campaign management has fallen under the scrutiny of an FBI inquiry, which is sure to blossom into a formal criminal investigation centered on Trump’s disgraced ex-manager Paul Manafort’s stewardship of the Republican campaign and his close ties to Ukraine. When he departed, Manafort was facing felony charges, and now the FBI’s suspicions have been confirmed by the evidence.
New York Times found Ukrainian documents which outlined $12.7 million in previously unreported payments from a Ukrainian political party to Manafort, precipitating his departure from the campaign.
In August 2016, the New York Times published a report that a secret ledger had been unearthed in Ukraine showing $12.7 million in payments designated from Viktor Yanukovych’s pro-Russian political party to Manafort between 2007 and 2012. When the story was published, anti-corruption officials in Ukraine told the paper that they had not yet determined whether Manafort had actually received the money.
The Occupy Democrats story was based on a later 1 November 2016 NBC report:
The FBI has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort’s foreign business connections, law enforcement and intelligence sources told NBC News.
Word of the inquiry, which has not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation, comes just days after FBI Director James Comey’s disclosure that his agency is examining a new batch of emails connected to an aide to Hillary Clinton.


While an unnamed source apparently spoke to NBC, the FBI at that time had not not announced an inquiry into Manafort’s activities — the Bureau, generally, does not officially confirm whether or not they are investigating a matter, and they responded to our inquiry by saying just that. Similarly, they gave no formal statement to NBC.
But on 20 March 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey broke from that practice to announce the FBI was in fact investigating allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. During a public hearing of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey said:
The FBI, as part of our counterintelligence effort, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 president election.
Less than two months later, President Trump fired Comey, prompting Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein, who had been given oversight of the Russia investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself amid questions about his own communications with Russians, hired Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
On 26 July 2017, FBI agents conducted an early-morning raid on the home of then-candidate Trump’s former campaign chair Paul Manafort.

The web site failed to note that these two pieces of evidence contradicted one another — if Clinton was too afraid to get out of her car, how was she also photographed talking to the crowd, clearly not in a vehicle?

The photograph from the New York Times is real, and does show Clinton with a crowd of people (some of whom were holding Trump/Pence signs) in Pompano Beach, Florida. It is also evidence that the message posted by “Salty Dad,” claiming that Clinton “refused to exit her vehicle,” is inaccurate. 


On 30 October 2016, Clinton spent much of the day touring Broward County. According to the caption on the New York Times photograph, her Pompano Beach visit was an impromptu stop to greet a group of early voters:
Hillary Clinton made an unannounced visit on Sunday to an early-voting site in Pompano Beach, Fla.
The Sun-Sentinel noted that the visit occurred outside the Emma Lou Olson Civic Center, not the Pompano Beach Amphitheater (where she was not scheduled to host a rally to begin with) and that while a few people chanted “lock her up,” it didn’t stop Clinton from taking a few selfies with supporters:
She also traveled to Pompano Beach to visit people outside the early voting site at the Emma Lou Olson Civic Center. Jennie Jones, of Pompano Beach, took a selfie with Clinton, which she said she couldn’t wait to show her grandchildren.
“She’s the next president of the United States,” said Betty Nesbitt of Fort Lauderdale, who yelled “I love you Hillary” to her candidate.
About a half dozen Trump supporters who were at the early voting site holding signs for their candidate got a chance to express a different view. “Lock her up,” yelled Gary Moss, of Pompano Beach.

","On 2 November 2016, Fox News’ Bret Baier reported that unnamed FBI sources had confirmed that at least five foreign intelligence agencies are known to have hacked Hillary Clinton’s e-mail server, that several investigations are ongoing — including a criminal probe of “pay-for-play” allegations regarding the Clinton Foundation — and that an indictment will “likely” result.
After the accuracy of these claims was disputed by other news outlets, however, Baier admitted his reporting had been erroneous:
I explained a couple of times yesterday the phrasing of one of my answers to Brit Hume on Wednesday night, saying it was inartful, the way I answered the last question about whether the investigations would continue after the election. And I answered that, yes, our sources said it would. They would continue to likely to an indictment. Well, that just wasn’t inartful, it was a mistake, and for that I’m sorry. I should have said, they will continue to build their case. Indictment obviously is a very loaded word, Jon, especially in this atmosphere and no one knows if there would or would not be an indictment no matter how strong investigators feel their evidence is. It is obviously a prosecutor who has to agree to take the case and make that case to a grand jury.
Baier also contradicted his own report that the FBI had established a “99% certainty” that at least five foreign entities hacked Clinton’s private server:
On the hacking of Clinton’s private, unsecured server, while multiple sources believe and are operating under the working assumption that the server has been hacked, and some had specific quotes to that belief, there are, to this day no digital fingerprints of such breaches.


Unfortunately, by the time he issued his corrections Baier’s original, inaccurate reporting had already sparked a flurry of even more inaccurate reports from unreliable web sites claiming that Clinton herself had been “officially indicted” for treason. This specimen, for example, was posted on Ending the Fed on 3 November 2016, and got a considerable amount of play via social media:
BREAKING: Department of Homeland Security Chairman Officially Indicts Hillary Clinton Of TREASON
The Department of Homeland Security just went on the air with Fox News and told the American People that Hillary Clinton is guilty of treason.
In the damning announcement, Department of Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul revealed that Hillary Clinton clearly acted against the multiple security warnings she received while Secretary of State.
Furthermore, he went on to release that Hillary Clinton took multiple devices overseas. Not only that, these devices were proven to be hacked by China, Russia, and the Islamic State of Iran.
The intent is clear. Hillary Clinton used the secret server to hide her actions from the American People. She committed pure treason against the United States. Here is the full video:
The article is egregiously inaccurate in these key respects:
1. Congressman Michael McCaul (R-TX), who appears in the video above, is not the “Department of Homeland Security chairman” (there is no such entity). McCaul is the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.
2. While McCaul did state in the video that in his opinion Hillary Clinton is guilty of “treason” for using a private e-mail server while Secretary of State, he did not announce an indictment — nor, indeed, would he have the judicial power, as a Congressman, to secure such an indictment — against Clinton.
3. As we know from Bret Baier’s own corrections, it is not the case that any government official has gone on record saying an indictment of Clinton is likely, much less that an indictment already went forward.",FALSE,2016-11-04

During Friday Night’s Hillary Clinton rally in Ohio, Beyonce’ Knowles, known for her liberal ideals and anti-police rhetoric, was performing a free set for the murderous email queen when she suddenly stopped singing. She turned towards the side of the stage where Hillary was standing and said, “You’re in my earpiece.”
Clinton, looking surprised, gave a smile and started clapping. Beyonce’ continued her performance but cut it short after just two songs. She was seen storming off stage and leaving the venue in a limousine shortly thereafter.
A reporter from the local Parma Gazette asked around and found out from a sound tech that Clinton’s lapel mic was hot and all of the staff were listening when she said:
“I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”
Although a large number of people who shared the story via social media apparently thought it was true, the incident reported therein did not occur.

","It’s a head-scratcher. No one seems to know how it happened, but the ballots printed up for use by Lonoke County, Arkansas residents in the 2016 general election contained a suspicious typo: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s name is spelled with an extra “i” — “Hilliary” — as in “Hil-liar-y.”
KARK 4 News in central Arkansas confirmed the misspelling with county elections officials, who said it happened despite multiple proofreadings:
“It is amazing that that many people missed it,” Jerry Shepard, chairman of the Lonoke County Election Commission, said.

“Hillary has an extra I in it, but Clinton is spelled perfectly correctly,” Shepard said.
Shepard, we should note, is a Republican, though his fellow commissioner Jimmy Wallace is a Democrat, and Wallace agreed that no defamation was intended. Not everyone was willing to take it for granted that the misspelling was an innocent mistake, however.

They spelt it “Hilliary” which I’ve seen some of my friends say Lonoke county did this on purpose to spell liar.

The pin Kaine is seen wearing features a blue star on a white background surrounded by a red border.

","In spite of the fact that the above statement attributed to Democratic presidential nominee and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton has been circulating via social media since at least March 2015, no source, date or venue has ever been cited for it. It’s not to be found in any public speech or interview ever given by Clinton, nor any document written by her, in searchable online databases. Moreover, there is no record of any statements made by Clinton that even vaguely resemble the sentiments expressed above.
Judging from the way the passage is constructed, it was not only fabricated, but fabricated with satirical intent. It simply makes no sense — except in a joke made at Hillary Clinton’s expense — for her to describe herself as “the most powerful woman in America.” Nor does it make sense — except in a spoof questioning Clinton’s intelligence and competence — for a Western leader to equate the imposition of Sharia Law with freedom and democracy.

58,KIM LACAPRIA,Is the Green Party on the Ballot in All 50 States?,"After the major political parties’ national conventions concluded in July 2016, Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein drew the attention of many disaffected progressive voters, prompting inquiries about whether Dr. Stein and the Green Party had secured ballot access in all 50 states.
Stein’s candidacy hit a definite tipping point after Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton, triggering a voter shift dubbed “Demexit” by some participants. But while Sanders sought the nomination of a major party, Stein (often lumped together with Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson) mounted a third-party run without automatic universal ballot access.
According to a ballot access map published on Stein’s campaign site and apparently dated 2 August 2016, the candidate had qualified to appear on ballots in roughly only half the states:

We’re already on the ballot in 23 states (including the District of Columbia). But we need your help to get on the ballot in the remaining states listed below. A list of Ballot Access Coordinators can be found here.
High-priority states are Connecticut and New Hampshire.
If you live in a state where we’re already on the ballot, you might be allowed to travel to a neighboring state to petition—if the state law allows. Please check in with the specific state’s coordinator(s) to find out and to plan.
A 1 August 2016 press release issued by the Green Party reiterated the figure of having achieved ballot access in 23 states, with between nine and 15 more states pending:
Ballot access was also achieved in Vermont for the first time ever. Over 1400 signatures were submitted that had already been certified as valid by town clerks across the state.
The Green Party now has ballot access in 23 states, are awaiting government certification for 9 more (including the six states mentioned here), and have active petition drives in 15 more states.


According to the press release, the Green Party does not necessarily expect to qualify for the ballot in all 50 states:
Presumptive presidential nominee Jill Stein will be formally nominated by the Green Party at the party’s national convention in Houston on Saturday, August 6th. The Green Party is actively petitioning to be on the ballot in at least 47 states for the general election in November, enough to potentially win an electoral college vote.
The initiative to secure Green Party ballot access came amid what pollsters said was atypically high interest in third-party candidates during the 2016 election:
Voters now confronted with the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are making something abundantly clear: They want another option. Surveys over the last six weeks have found a steady but noticeable jump in support for third-party candidates. The biggest beneficiary has been Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, who has shot up from 4.5 percent to 7.2 percent in RealClearPolitics polling averages. Green Party candidate Jill Stein has also seen an uptick since June — from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent.
The surge in support for a third-party candidate is adding a new element of unpredictability into the presidential race. Should voters opt for a third-party candidate in large numbers, it could potentially tip the scales in crucial battleground states. Pollsters and political scientists say the deep malcontent with Clinton and Trump should give both candidates pause.
“The fact that we have two major party candidates who are enormously disliked by the electorate, enormously and equally disliked, creates the opportunity for the minor party candidates to do better than they would in other presidential elections,” said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.
“The minor party candidates can have great influence if the final race is very close.”
Although Dr. Stein and the Green Party have actively sought ballot access in up to 15 states, Libertarian Party candidate Johnson did not face the same uphill challenge for ballot access:
Patrick Murray, the Monmouth University pollster who was the first to put Johnson on a national poll, said that he doesn’t think voters are viewing third-party support as an ideological choice.
Johnson has received significantly more media coverage than Stein, taking to cable news to tout the potential endorsement of 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Murray and other pollsters believe that he may be seen as the de facto third-party candidate for those looking to lodge a protest vote.
“For those who really feel they cannot vote for either of the two major party nominees, Johnson is nominally the most visible alternative,” Murray said … Utah is fertile ground for Johnson right now, as an internal poll from Republican Rep. Mia Love’s campaign found him just 3 points behind Trump and 1 point behind Clinton, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.
As of 2 August 2016, the Green Party and Stein’s ticket have ballot access in 23 states. Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson is set to appear on all 50 state ballots, but he has yet to achieve the 15 percent polling level required to appear in televised presidential debates.
As of September 2016, the Green Party affirmed Stein was on the ballot in 45 states (including Washington, D.C.):
September 10 update: Our petitioning drive in all states has ended. Americans in 48 states (including DC) are able to cast a vote for Stein/Baraka on November 8.

59,DAVID MIKKELSON,"For All Jews Voting for Hillary
","This photograph of the Clinton family posing with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hit social media in August 2016, where it was circulated with a legend reading “A sweet picture before you go to sleep. For all Jews voting for Hillary.” It’s unclear whether whoever crafted that legend expected Jewish voters to be outraged by a reminder that the Clintons ever countenanced the controversial former PLO chairman, or expected younger Jewish voters wouldn’t recognize Arafat (who died in 2004) and would just viscerally react to a picture of President Clinton’s wife and daughter smiling and wearing headscarves to cozy up to some Middle Eastern-looking guy.
Yasser Arafat was Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), and during his term of office President Bill Clinton was involved in multiple negotiations with Arafat and Israeli leaders to end the decades-long conflict between the two sides. In 1994, Arafat shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and foreign minister Shimon Peres “for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East”.
In any case, the occasion for the photograph shown here was a gathering of several world leaders in Morocco for the funeral of King Hassan II, during which meetings centered on pushing forward the Middle East peace process occurred between President Clinton, Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, and Palestinian president Arafat. The image presented above is a little misleading, as it has been cropped to imply that the Clintons were posing alone with Arafat, when in fact they were jointly posing with Turkish president Suleyman Demirel:

60,BROOKE BINKOWSKI,Obama Bribed Iran $400 Million to Release U.S. Prisoners?,"In January 2016, the Obama administration successfully negotiated the release of four Americans who had been imprisoned in Iran in exchange for the release of seven Iranians who had been imprisoned in the United States.(A fifth American prisonerwas released separately.) At around the same time, the U.S. airlifted the equivalent of USD $400 million in various currencies to Tehran, sparking conspiracy theories about the timing:
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) was among those who seized on the timing and cloak-and-dagger delivery method, which was first reportedby the Wall Street Journal, saying it proved suspicions that the Obama administration had tried to hide a payment for the four Americans, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. GOP candidate Donald Trump called it an example of the administration’s foreign policy failures.
“Obama administration sent plane load of cash to #Iran as ransom as part of deal on hostages. Just unreal,” tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a long-standing critic of the Iran talks.
As with other issues that would normally fall by the wayside in a normal daily news cycle, the payout to Iran became prime fodder for yet another election-year debate:
State Department spokesman John Kirby joined Bill Hemmer on “America’s Newsroom” to defend a $400 million cash transfer to Iran during the release of four Iranian-held U.S. hostages.
Kirby said the money had been frozen in a trust fund in the U.S. for decades and it was “their money.”
He asserted that the fact that the transaction occurred during the release of the detained Americans was “coincidental.” Hemmer pressed Kirby, saying that it appears that this cash transfer was kept secret and was effectively a “ransom.”
“It looks bad,” Hemmer said.
However, the $400 million dollar transfer was actually an openly announced one, paid in settlement of a nearly 40-year dispute between Iran and the United States — a settlement that likely saved the United States several billion dollars.


Back in late 1979, after Iranian revolutionaries took 52 Americans hostage at the US Embassy in Tehran, the United States severed diplomatic relations with Iran and froze Iranian assets in America. Among those frozen assets was a $400 million delivery of fighter jets from the U.S. that Iran’s previous government had already paid for.
Although the American hostages were finally released a year later, issues such as the frozen Iranian assets (including that $400 million) were not settled at that time. Instead, an international court based in the Hague, the Iran–United States Claims Tribunal was established to deal with such legal claims. The tribunal process dragged on for years and years without a ruling on the $400 million being issued, and finally, when arbitration process was apparently about to wind up (quite possibly not in American’s favor), the U.S. agreed to pay Iran back the $400 million principal along with $1.3 billion in interest. If the issue had gone to the tribunal for a decision, as was expected, the U.S. could have been on the hook for the full $10 billion in compensation Iran was seeking.
It is true the U.S. agreed to the settlement at the same time it was negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran and for the return of four U.S. citizens who had been detained by Iran. However, the negotiations over these these issues were conducted by completely separate teams in order to avoid any overlap or suggestions of connections between them.
As Vox noted, charges that the U.S. had paid “ransom” to Iran for the release of hostages didn’t even make logical sense:
The payment, which sounds really shady out of context, was actually the end of a boring, decades-old international legal case totally unrelated to the hot-button nuclear and prisoner issues.
[T]here was no direct evidence to back up [the ransom] theory. The speculation about timing was just that — speculation.
Iranian negotiators on the prisoner exchange were not the same negotiators involved in the weapons deal settlement. Therefore, they couldn’t make demands of the US team negotiating the weapons deal settlement, which means they couldn’t negotiate a quid pro quo of money for hostage release, the definition of a ransom.
Moreover, the basic logic of it didn’t make any sense. Iran was going to get that money back no matter what through the arbitration process — probably more, if the Obama administration was right. Why would [Iran] release potentially valuable hostages in exchange for money it would have gotten otherwise? Iran would have to be the world’s dumbest hostage taker.
Even though the Obama administration openly announced the settlement in January 2016, it wasn’t until several months later that claims the U.S. had offered a “ransom payment” began to circulate due to spin from some Iranian officials. But Vox also noted that spin wasn’t too credible:
[One cited] piece of evidence for the payment being a ransom is that the Iranians spun it that way.
But of course Iranian officials would spin it as a hostage payment. This makes them look strong to their domestic audience and America look weak. We don’t take political spin from American officials at face value, so we shouldn’t take Iranian spin at face value either — especially when it’s contradicted by independent evidence.
By delivering the payment on the same day as the prisoner release, Iranian officials could claim that they got the money as part of a ransom deal.
But the truth is that the Iranians could have claimed that no matter when the cash was delivered. If the Obama administration had forked over $400 million six months later, those same Iranian defense officials could have lied and said it was part of the prisoner release deal rather than the weapons settlement.
The lie isn’t significantly more credible just because the cash was delivered on the same day. Nor should American media and politicians help validate the Iranian lie by treating Iranian propaganda as actual evidence.
On 18 August 2016, the Obama administration acknowledged that delivery of the $400 million payment due to Iran in settlement of the dispute over payment for military equipment had been held up until officials were sure that American prisoners Iran had agreed to free in a separate deal were safely away:
State Department spokesman John Kirby addressed questions by explaining that the U.S. held on to the $400 million cash payment until American prisoners were on a plane and safely away from Iran to “retain maximum leverage.” Kirby said the arrangement did not in any way constitute a ransom payment, as President Barack Obama’s Republican critics have alleged.
“We deliberately leveraged that moment to finalize these outstanding issues nearly simultaneously,” he said. “With concerns that Iran may renege on the prisoner release, given unnecessary delays regarding persons in Iran who could not be located as well as, to be quite honest, mutual mistrust between Iran and the United States, we of course sought to retain maximum leverage until after American citizens were released. That was our top priority.”

The fact that the money was physically sent to Iran in various currencies  rather than simply transferred by wire may seem odd in the context of the United States’ increasingly cashless society, but that was done in order to avoid existing Treasury Department sanctions that banned the use of American currency in transactions with Iran, and international sanctions which at that time kept Iran from accessing the global financial markets (and which were lifted in January 2016).",FALSE,2016-08-03
61,KIM LACAPRIA,"President Obama Is Banning the ‘Don’t Tread on Me’ Flag?
","On 3 August 2016, Washington Post legal analyst Eugene Volokh published an articleabout an Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC) decision that reportedly found in favor of an employee who filed a complaint about a co-worker’s fondness for wearing caps bearing a representation of the Gadsden Flag (known better by the legend “Don’t Tread On Me”).
Structured as a legal expert’s opinion, the article evaluated the nature of decision without all the underlying details of the EEOC’s ruling (which are not yet available):
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, among its other functions, decides “hostile work environment” harassment claims brought against federal agencies. In doing so, it applies the same legal rules that courts apply to private employers, and that the EEOC follows in deciding whether to sue private employers. The EEOC has already ruled that coworkers’ wearing Confederate flag T-shirts can be punishable harassment (a decision that I think is incorrect); and, unsurprisingly, this is extending to other political speech as well.
Volokh also reproduced a portion of EEOC decision:
On January 8, 2014, Complainant filed a formal complaint in which he alleged that the Agency subjected him to discrimination on the basis of race (African American) and in reprisal for prior EEO activity when, starting in the fall of 2013, a coworker (C1) repeatedly wore a cap to work with an insignia of the Gadsden Flag, which depicts a coiled rattlesnake and the phrase “Don’t Tread on Me.”
Complainant stated that he found the cap to be racially offensive to African Americans because the flag was designed by Christopher Gadsden, a “slave trader & owner of slaves.” Complainant also alleged that he complained about the cap to management; however, although management assured him C1 would be told not to wear the cap, C1 continued to come to work wearing the offensive cap … Complainant maintains that the Gadsden Flag is a “historical indicator of white resentment against blacks stemming largely from the Tea Party.” He notes that the Vice President of the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters cited the Gadsden Flag as the equivalent of the Confederate Battle Flag when he successfully had it removed from a New Haven, Connecticut fire department flagpole.
After a thorough review of the record, it is clear that the Gadsden Flag originated in the Revolutionary War in a non-racial context. Moreover, it is clear that the flag and its slogan have been used to express various non-racial sentiments, such as when it is used in the modern Tea Party political movement, guns rights activism, patriotic displays, and by the military.
However, whatever the historic origins and meaning of the symbol, it also has since been sometimes interpreted to convey racially-tinged messages in some contexts. For example, in June 2014, assailants with connections to white supremacist groups draped the bodies of two murdered police officers with the Gadsden flag during their Las Vegas, Nevada shooting spree … Certainly, Complainant ascribes racial connotations to the symbol based on observations that it is sometimes displayed in racially-tinged situations.
In light of the ambiguity in the current meaning of this symbol, we find that Complainant’s claim must be investigated to determine the specific context in which C1 displayed the symbol in the workplace. In so finding, we are not prejudging the merits of Complainant’s complaint. Instead, we are precluding a procedural dismissal that would deprive us of evidence that would illuminate the meaning conveyed by C1’s display of the symbol.


From the small amount of information available it was difficult to determine from a non-legal perspective whether any specific decision was reached at all, much less one “banning” the Gadsden flag from the workplace. Volokh stated that he was unable to view the source material in full because EEOC proceedings in this case are confidential:
Nothing in the opinion suggests that the cap wearer said anything racist to Shelton D.; I’ve read many such EEOC decisions, and they generally list all the significant allegations of harassment. (I can’t access the specific complaint in the case, because all that information is kept secret in EEOC proceedings.)
Volokh raised a number of compelling questions about the implications of such a ruling in his analysis, but the information available didn’t confirm that the Gadsden flag (or its “Don’t Tread On Me” legend) had been banned from any workplace (much less every workplace).
An EEOC representative whom we contacted for more information told us, among other things, that the decision only dealt with whether the referenced complaint should be investigated or dismissed and did not make any determination that discrimination had actually occurred or that the Gadsden flag was a “racist symbol:
· This decision addressed only the procedural issue of whether the complainant’s allegations of discrimination should be dismissed or investigated.
· Given the procedural nature of this appeal and the fact that no investigative record or evidence had been developed yet, it would have been premature and inappropriate for the EEOC to determine, one way or the other, the merits of the agency’s argument that the Gadsden Flag and its slogan do not have any racial connotations whatsoever.
· The EEOC’s decision simply ordered the agency to investigate the allegations. The EEOC’s decision made no factual or legal determination on whether discrimination actually occurred.
The Commission did not find that the Gadsden Flag in fact is a racist symbol. Rather, the Commission found only that the complaint met the legal standard to state a claim under Title VII, and therefore should have been investigated by the agency rather than dismissed.
In other words, a Postal Service employee (not someone in the private sector) complained of racial harassment and retaliation. One of the elements of his complaint was that a co-worker wore a cap with the Gasden flag, which he found harassing.
The Postal Service dismissed the claim without an investigation or hearing. This was appealed to the EEOC.
The EEOC ruled that it could not make a decision whether harassment occurred given the total lack of facts.
Most emphatically, the EEOC made no determination as to whether wearing the Gasden flag alone constituted harassment. The matter was sent back to the Postal Service for investigation and an hearing, to result in a final agency decision on the merits.
Let me also clear up some incorrect assertions floating around about confidentiality. Just like in the private sector, complaints in the federal sector must be kept confidential. This goes for investigations and hearings. Only after the decision has been appealed to the EEOC and EEOC has issued a decision, does the decision itself become public. These appellate decisions are available on our website: https://www.eeoc.gov/federal/decisions.cfm
Note: because there can be a couple of months lag time between issuance and publication, the decision is not yet on our website.",Mostly False,2016-08-05
62,SNOPES STAFF,"Trump Said He’d Drop Out If Polls Showed Him Losing to Hillary?
","Amid much speculation in early August 2016 about the possibility that beleaguered GOP nominee Donald Trump might drop out of the presidential race (and what would happen if he did), the image displayed above hit Facebook. That image inaccurately implied that Donald Trump had recently proclaimed during an appearance on the Meet the Press public affairs program that he would “drop out of the race before November” if “it’s apparent in the polls that I’m going to lose to Hillary [Clinton].”
Actually, the referenced Meet the Press interview with Trump had taken place nine months earlier (on 4 October 2015), just four months after the business magnate announced his candidacy, well before any primary elections had been held, and long before either major party had selected a nominee. Trump’s response to a question by interviewer Chuck Todd about dropping out of the campaign and going back to running his businesses if polls showed him losing specifically referred to the long race for the Republican nomination that still lay ahead, not to the general election that was still more than a year off:
CHUCK TODD: You said something the other day that caught me off-guard. You said you’re not a masochist. And if you start falling in the poll you’ll go back to your business. What does that mean? Are you not in this for the long haul?
DONALD TRUMP: If I was dropping in the polls where I saw that I wasn’t gonna win, why would I continue? I believe in polls. How many elections do you see where the polls were wrong? Not that many. Okay. You see ’em, but not that many. If I were doing poorly, if I saw myself going down, if you would stop calling me ’cause you no longer have any interest in Trump because “he has no chance,” I’d go back to my business. I have no problem with that.

In his most recent Meet the Press appearance, which took place on 24 July 2016 (just after the Republican National Convention had officially nominated him as the party’s presidential candidate), Trump sounded nothing like a candidate pondering dropping out of the race:
CHUCK TODD: One of the phrases you used, “I alone can fix it.” And to some people, that sounded almost too strong — mannish for them. Do you understand that criticism and what do you make of it?
DONALD TRUMP: I’ll tell you, part of it was I’m comparing myself to Hillary. And we know Hillary, and we look at her record. Her record has been a disaster. And I am running against Hillary. It’s not like I’m running against the rest of the world. I know people that are very, very capable that could do a very good job, but they could never get elected.
I can tell you right now. I can give you ten names of people that would do an extraordinary job, but there’s no way they could ever get elected. They wouldn’t know where to begin. It wouldn’t be for them. But for governing, they would be good. I’m running and, you know, against one person.",Mostly False,2016-08-05
63,DAVID EMERY,"Khizr Khan Received $375,000 from the Clinton Foundation","The speaking appearance of Muslim attorney and Gold Star father Khizr Khan at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, at which he criticized Republican nominee Donald Trump for his lack of empathy for immigrants, unleashed a firestorm of rebukes and attempts to discredit him, including unsubstantiated allegations that Khan has “deep legal and financial connections” to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. 
One of those attempts hinged on an image (see below) purporting to show a Wells Fargo bank statement in the name of Khan’s law firm which lists a $375,000 wire transfer from The Clinton Foundation, Bill Clinton’s nonprofit organization devoted to addressing global issues. Exactly how and where it originated is unknown, but the image made one of its first appearances on a page dated 4 August 2016 on the Get Off the BS web site, where it was introduced as follows:
Well now with some help from a member of the awesome freedom fighter group Anonymous, we have some more interesting information about Mr. Khan and his unethical connection with Crooked Hillary and her charitable money laundering foundation–did we say that?
Due to litigation concerns [no doubt a lawsuit is forthcoming – screw you Khan] we are not going to make other comments than to use your own imagination what this payment is for.  We will open up comments so that you can discuss this matter among yourselves.
“Hey girl, we have been monitoring one of several bank accounts for Khan’s law firms.  Attached, please take a hard look at the payment from Clinton’s foundation to Khan’s law firm.  Should not take a MBA to figure what he was paid for.  Enjoy.”

The document appears to be a Wells Fargo Business Market Savings account statement for the KM Khan Law Office, address listed as 415 Madison Ave., Suite 1500, New York, NY. In the transaction history is an 8/1 “Clinton foundation incoming wire” entry credited in the amount of $375,000. One of the first things you’ll note about the document, however, is that it’s heavily redacted — so heavily that you can’t even find a complete date on it anywhere. The second thing you’ll notice, if you look carefully, is that the business name is listed twice in the document, and the listings don’t match.
First it’s listed as “KM KHAN LAW OFFICE”:



Then it’s listed as “JM KHAN LAW OFFICE”:

At some point as the image was being passed around and reposted, someone noticed the discrepancy and created a new version:

But if you’ll notice, the new version has a defect as well: “KM KHAN LAW OFFICE” — singular — has now become “KM KHAN LAW OFFICES” — plural.
This forged document — pick your favorite version, it doesn’t matter — would have been laughed out of a court of law. Indeed, the “evidence” is so inconsistent that it’s hard to believe anyone could mistake it, much less try to pass it off, as real. Needless to say, it doesn’t prove that Khizr Khan received $375,000 from the Clinton Foundation; all it proves is that someone wants you to think he did.",FALSE,2016-08-06
64,DAVID EMERY,"Hillary Clinton: Christians in America Must Deny Their Faith
","On 23 April 2015, Hillary Clinton delivered the keynote address at the annual Women in the World Summit in New York City. In a 20-minute speech that touched on the triumphs and challenges of improving the plight of women and girls worldwide, Clinton emphasized the work yet to be done:
Yes, we’ve nearly closed the global gender gap in primary school, but secondary school remains out of reach for so many girls around the world. Yes, we’ve increased the number of countries prohibiting domestic violence, but still more than half the nations in the world have no such laws on the books, and an estimated one in three women still experience violence. Yes, we’ve cut the mortality rate in half, but far too many women are still denied critical access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth.
All the laws we’ve passed don’t count for much if they’re not enforced. Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.
As I have said, and as I believe, the advancement of the full participation of women and girls in every aspect of their societies is the great unfinished business of the twenty-first century, and not just for women but for everyone — and not just in far away countries but right here in the United States.”
Interestingly, within a day of Clinton’s address, an excerpt from the passage above was being passed around on the Internet, misrepresented as a demand for Christians to renounce their faith.
“Sorry Christians,” a blog called the Right Scoop intoned ominously on 24 April 2015, “but your religious beliefs against abortion aren’t good enough anymore. They must be changed.”
“Hilary Clinton just said that Christians must deny their Faith through the enforcement of laws, by stating that the Christian belief in being pro-life, and anti-abortion, must change,” warned Shoebat.com, “and that this should be done through laws and ‘political will.’ If Christians must change Christian teachings in regards to abortion, then what Hilary Clinton is essentially saying is that Christians must deny their Faith.”


Shoebat continued: “Notice that she says that the change of Christian beliefs is the ‘unfinished business of the 21st century,’ which means she wants to persecute Christians.”
Having read the pertinent paragraphs from Clinton’s actual speech above, one might well wonder how her call for the enforcement of laws protecting the rights of women in countries with deep-seated cultural biases morphed into a demand for American Christians to deny their faith. Quite simply, it was done by editing out the context so only these remarks are left (emphasis added by Shoebat.com):
Far too many women are denied access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth, and laws don’t count for much if they’re not enforced.Rights have to exist in practice — not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.
Gone are all references to education, domestic violence, and the mortality rate of women in childbirth — not to mention the international scope of the subject matter — so what remains could be misrepresented as a direct threat to pro-life Christians in America. That was clearly not the original import of the passage.",FALSE,2016-08-08

","In August 2016, at the height of the presidential campaign, a Reddit user programmed a robot to respond to any mention of the words “tax return” with a comment insinuating that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump refuses to release his tax returns because he has donated millions of dollars to an organization that promotes pederasty.
The bot called AutoModerator responds to every comment in the sub-reddit EnoughTrumpSpam with the phrase:
Speaking of tax returns, did you hear Donald Trump is refusing to release them because Donald Trump has donated to NAMBLA? That’s what all the best sources, the most tremendous sources are saying, and if they’re all saying that Donald Trump donated to NAMBLA, well, I can see why Donald Trump would want to cover up his donations to NAMBLA. I’m not claiming that Donald Trump donates to NAMBLA, but that’s what these excellent sources are alleging, that Donald Trump does indeed donate to NAMBLA.
The phrase is accompanied by a disclaimer that it was generated by a bot. But that hasn’t stopped the oblique accusation that Trump may be a member of the North American Man/Boy Love Association from making its way around the Internet:



Also, @seanhannity? Look into this disgusting Trump/NAMBLA nonsense. So gross how the left lies.  Trump.  NAMBLA.  Say that every night.

A Reddit user who calls himself J. Peterman — possibly a reference to a character on the television sitcom Seinfeld — said he created the bot to mock Trump for his habit of making claims that he attributes to nameless “people:”
I created it by taking advantage of an existing bot, /u/automoderator, made available for all moderators to use to automate certain tasks, and you can make custom code for the subreddit’s configuration of auto moderator. I did that and I made it reply to the trigger word “tax returns” with the copy/paste you see.
For example, in June 2016, Trump hinted that President Barack Obama may have had a connection to the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, saying:
People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can’t even mention the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism.’ There’s something going on. It’s inconceivable. There’s something going on… He doesn’t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands — it’s one or the other, and either one is unacceptable.
A Reddit moderator who goes by “Faiz” and claims to have helped launch the bot told us that he believes it turns Trump’s own manner of generating suspicions against his opponents against him:
We didn’t expect it to take off like this, but the community effort on EnoughTrumpSpam really helped it go viral. The joke spread off Reddit and began confusing people so much so that some news outlets even began picking the story up. I think it’s success is, in a way, emblematic of the way Trump spreads lies and gets people to believe them by constantly repeating them.
A random user originally posted the block of text and it became instantly popular on Reddit. We all loved it because of how much it imitated Trump’s style of making unsubstantiated accusations. You really can’t tell the difference between some of the text in the meme and some things Trump wrote during Obama’s birther conspiracy.
As for why Trump, we picked it up mostly because, as suggested by the name (EnoughTrumpSpam), we are an anti-Trump community and we found this to be a perfect foil to highlight the way Trump spreads conspiracy theories.
J. Peterman said he was taken aback by how much attention the bot generated. The prank seems to have caught fire, with someone jumping in to create a fake Fox News page with the title: “NAMBLA neither confirms nor denies Trump’s donation allegations.” 
Now that it’s taken off, I’m quite surprised. I’m surprised by how much press attention the bot’s coding has garnered as well as the meme in general. I cannot take credit for creating the meme, that was around for a week or so before I did the bot, and it was everyone else who kept the meme going.


Faiz, the moderator, said he hopes that the prank goes far enough that Trump’s campaign is forced to respond to it. The ultimate coup de grâce, he told the Daily Beast, would be if it forces Trump to do something he has adamantly refused to do: release his tax returns.
“The only logical conclusion would really be Trump releasing his tax returns but he would never do that because he’s hiding donations to NAMBLA,” Faiz told the Daily Beast. “That’s what I’ve heard from some very smart people anyway.”
You can see the bot in action in the screenshot taken from Reddit here:

67,KIM LACAPRIA,"Fifty Former National Security Officials Disavow Trump in Formal Statement
","On 8 August 2016, a letter appeared purporting to be from a group of former national security officials, all Republicans, and all vowing not to vote for Donald Trump and declaring him a threat to the nation:
The undersigned individuals have all served in senior national security and/or foreign policy positions in Republican Administrations, from Richard Nixon to George W. Bush. We have worked directly on national security issues with these Republican Presidents and/or their principal advisers during wartime and other periods of crisis, through successes and failures. We know the personal qualities required of a President of the United States.
None of us will vote for Donald Trump.
From a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. Indeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous President and would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being.
Most fundamentally, Mr. Trump lacks the character, values, and experience to be President. He weakens U.S. moral authority as the leader of the free world. He appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws, and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary.
In addition, Mr. Trump has demonstrated repeatedly that he has little understanding of America’s vital national interests, its complex diplomatic challenges, its indispensable alliances, and the democratic values on which U.S. foreign policy must be based. At the same time, he persistently compliments our adversaries and threatens our allies and friends. Unlike previous Presidents who had limited experience in foreign affairs, Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself. He continues to display an alarming ignorance of basic facts of contemporary international politics. Despite his lack of knowledge, Mr. Trump claims that he understands foreign affairs and “knows more about ISIS than the generals do.”
Mr. Trump lacks the temperament to be President. In our experience, a President must be willing to listen to his advisers and department heads; must encourage consideration of conflicting views; and must acknowledge errors and learn from them. A President must be disciplined, control emotions, and act only after reflection and careful deliberation. A President must maintain cordial relationships with leaders of countries of different backgrounds and must have their respect and trust.
In our judgment, Mr. Trump has none of these critical qualities. He is unable or unwilling to separate truth from falsehood. He does not encourage conflicting views. He lacks self-control and acts impetuously. He cannot tolerate personal criticism. He has alarmed our closest allies with his erratic behavior. All of these are dangerous qualities in an individual who aspires to be President and Commander-in-Chief, with command of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
We understand that many Americans are profoundly frustrated with the federal government and its inability to solve pressing domestic and international problems. We also know that many have doubts about Hillary Clinton, as do many of us. But Donald Trump is not the answer to America’s daunting challenges and to this crucial election. We are convinced that in the Oval Office, he would be the most reckless President in American history.
The development was so unexpected that many readers were skeptical. However, news outlets published articles about the letter shortly after it appeared.  Trump, for his part, speculated that the signers were seeking publicity: 
I wasn’t using any of them. They would have loved to have been involved with the campaign… Look where the country is now on national policy. Look where we are on defense… Look at the mess we are in —whether it’s the Middle East or [anywhere] else and these were the people that have been there long time — Washington establishment people.

","The Fox News Channel (FNC), founded by media mogul Rupert Murdoch in 1996, has long since surpassed CNN to become the #1 news cable channel (in terms of viewership) in the United States. Billing itself as the “fair and balanced” alternative to existing news outlets, FNC has nonetheless been disparaged by some as a “right-wing propaganda machine” or “an extension of the Republican Party,” a criticism reflected in the attribution to former Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes the statement that “The truth is whatever people will believe.”
Although this statement is commonly credited to Ailes, rarely is it reproduced with any citation of detail or attribution. Upon occasion, though, it’s cited as having appeared in an (unnamed) 1984 book:
I feel it’s important to point out that “news” is the conveying of factual, provable information. Opinion (or editorial) is a writer’s opinion or personal perception of a fact.
Fox News, for example, even though it’s called “Fox News,” is mostly opinion. Roger Ailes, Fox News President, said, in a 1984 book, “The truth is whatever people will believe.” This means that this widely-respected “news” organization feels it’s perfectly acceptable to bend the truth to meet its needs.
These words do appear in a book that was published in 1984. However, that work, God Knows, was a novel by Joseph Heller (best known as the author of Catch-22) about the Biblical King David of Israel, and thus it includes no quotes from Roger Ailes:

As far as we can tell, this statement wasn’t attributed to Ailes until it appeared as such on a web forum in 2012, despite having been extant for nearly thirty years at that point.
Moreover, even if Ailes had ever said anything like “the truth is only what people believe,” he would only have been echoing a notion that has been with us for millennia, as recorded in the words of the fragmentary play Aleadae (“The Sons of Aleus”) by the ancient Greek tragedian Sophocles:",FALSE,2016-08-14

70,DAVID EMERY,Did LBJ Advocate: ‘Convince the Lowest White Man He’s Better Than the Best Colored Man’?,"As we’ve had occasion to point out previously, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson had a complicated relationship with issues of race. Born and raised in the South in the early part of the 20th century, Johnson grew up immersed in the prejudices of that time and place, then carried them with him into his nascent political career. MSNBC reporter Adam Serwer wrote:
For two decades in Congress he was a reliable member of the Southern bloc, helping to stonewall civil rights legislation. As [biographer Robert] Caro recalls, Johnson spent the late 1940s railing against the “hordes of barbaric yellow dwarves” in East Asia. Buying into the stereotype that blacks were afraid of snakes (who isn’t afraid of snakes?) he’d drive to gas stations with one in his trunk and try to trick black attendants into opening it. Once, Caro writes, the stunt nearly ended with him being beaten with a tire iron.
Yet by the time Johnson became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, he was ready to plow all of his political capital to the passage of the civil rights legislation initiated by his predecessor. By most accounts, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 couldn’t have become law when it did had not LBJ personally wheedled, cajoled, and shamed his former colleagues in the House and Senate into voting for it. One of the secrets of his success was the ability to speak the racially insensitive language of his fellow Southerners. He understood them. He understood their reluctance and in some cases downright refusal to tear down the walls of racial segregation. He knew racism from the inside, and he knew well the role the rich and powerful played in promulgating it.

That’s the context of one of the most famous statements on race ever attributed to President Johnson, an off-the-cuff observation he made to a young staffer, Bill Moyers, after encountering a display of blatant racism during a political visit to the South. Moyers tells it in the first person:
We were in Tennessee. During the motorcade, he spotted some ugly racial epithets scrawled on signs. Late that night in the hotel, when the local dignitaries had finished the last bottles of bourbon and branch water and departed, he started talking about those signs. “I’ll tell you what’s at the bottom of it,” he said. “If you can convince the lowest white man he’s better than the best colored man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he’ll empty his pockets for you.”

Whilst Trump is targeting Mexicans and Muslims, his new advisor and current governor of North Dakota has just given the green light to “shoot on sight” Indigenous tribes that are peacefully protesting against the Dakota pipeline.
Please share this with the world let them know how they are treating us… we are not terrorist! We are defending the land and the water! Protecting out future!
Anarchicnews cited three sources at the bottom of their article, but two of those sources included no mention of Governor Darlymple’s alleged order to shoot protesters, while the third source, a Facebook group, was inaccessible.
Anarchicnews made no mention of whom Governor Darlymple had given the “green light” to “shoot protesters on sight,” nor did they explain by what authority a state governor could order the indiscriminate shooting of people who posed no imminent threat to others’ lives. Moreover, if Gov. Darlymple truly had given someone a “green light” to shoot protesters “on sight,” it’s highly unlikely that the only source reporting this news would be a private Facebook group and an obscure blog.
Anarchicnews’ reporting is also discredited by the fact that indigenous people are still actively protesting the pipeline, in clear view of authorities, yet none of them has been taken out by forces allegedly told to “shoot [them] on sight.”
Governor Dalrymple declared a state of emergency in North Dakota to deal with the pipeline protests on 19 August 2016, proclaiming that the main goals behind his declaration were to ensure the safety of law enforcement, the general public, and the protesters:
Gov. Jack Dalrymple today authorized a restricted emergency declaration, making available additional state resources which may be needed to manage public safety risks associated with the ongoing protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline near Cannon Ball.
The Governor’s executive order does not include activation of the North Dakota National Guard, but makes available other state resources for the purpose of protecting the health, safety and well-being of the general public and those involved in the protest. The executive order can help the state and local agencies manage costs associated with providing a heightened law enforcement presence and activates the State Emergency Operations Plan to coordinate the efficient flow of resources.
“The State of North Dakota remains committed to protecting citizens’ rights to lawfully assemble and protest, but the unfortunate fact remains that unlawful acts associated with the protest near Cannon Ball have led to serious public safety concerns and property damage,” Gov. Dalrymple said. “This emergency declaration simply allows us to bring greater resources to bear if needed to help local officials address any further public safety concerns.”",FALSE,2016-08-28
72,KIM LACAPRIA,Gary Johnson Said Removal of Firing Pins Makes All Guns Fully Automatic?,"One of the things that particularly irks gun rights advocates is when politicians demonstrate an ignorance of how firearms actually work. After all, how can politicians be expected to prudently propose and vote on legislation affecting the manufacture, sale, and ownership of guns if they lack a basic understanding of the functionality of such weapons?
This sentiment was expressed in social media circles in September 2016 with the posting of an image of Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson along with text indicating that he had once said “guns can be made full auto by removing the firing pins”:

The claim that a legal semi-automatic weapon can be converted to an illegal fully automatic one simply through the removal of “a pin” is the bane of many gun aficionados, so it would be particularly irksome if a presidential candidate had actually expressed such a notion (and even more so if he referenced removing the “firing pin,” which would generally render the weapon inoperative).
As is common with such political images, this one provided no source or context for Johnson’s alleged statement. We found no documentation that he ever said any such thing, and the claim that he did likely originated with a misconstrual of a remark made by his running mate, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld.


In an August 2016 interview, Weld was asked whether ownership of AR-15s (a semi-automatic weapon commonly termed an “assault rifle”) should be restricted:
The shooting … at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando was at the hands of someone who had access to an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle … should those kind of weapons be available to people?
Weld responded as follows, citing Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen, who was able obtain a Sig Sauer MCX (similar to an AR-15) despite the prior presence of his name on an FBI terrorist watch list:
The five-shot rifle, that’s a standard military rifle; the problem is if you attach a clip to it so it can fire more shells and if you remove the pin so that it becomes an automatic weapon, and those are independent criminal offenses. That’s when they become essentially a weapon of mass destruction. The problem with handguns is probably even worse than the problem of the AR-15. You shouldn’t have anybody who’s on a terrorist watch list be able to buy any gun at all.
Weld didn’t use the term “firing pins” (just “a pin”) and he was talking about a particular type of firearm (rather than “any gun” or “all guns”), but to most gun advocates that’s probably bad enough. Likely Weld was mistakenly thinking of drop-in auto sears (DIAS) or other “part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun” under the definition of the National Firearms Act [PDF]:

Overall, both candidates on the Libertarian ticket have expressed unequivocal support for gun rights. In May 2016, Weld addressed controversy over his previous gun control positions by saying:
I am a lifelong hunter and gun owner. In 1993, however, as Governor of Massachusetts, I went along with some modest restrictions on certain types of firearms. I was deeply concerned about gun violence, and frankly, the people I represented were demanding action. Sometimes, governing involves tough choices, and I had to make more than a few.
Today, almost 25 years later, I would make some different choices. Restricting Americans’ gun rights doesn’t make us safer, and threatens our constitutional freedoms. I was pleased by and support the Supreme Court’s decision in the District of Columbia vs. Heller — a decision that embraced the notion that our Second Amendment rights are individual rights, not to be abridged by the government.
As for Johnson himself, in June 2016 he weighed in on the Orlando nightclub mass shooting by saying:
“I understand how so many people can believe that if you restrict this kind of weapon you can prevent this kind of incident,” said Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson in reaction to the murders in Orlando and the political calls to further restrict access to certain guns that arose after the shooting.
“But there’s just no evidence whatsoever to suggest that it makes us any safer, and in fact restricting guns makes things less safe, that’s the camp that I’m in,” he said.
“If everybody in that nightclub had a weapon?” he wonders. “The contrary argument is, if everyone were required to have a weapon or if 50 people in the room had a weapon, you could hear arguments, well, people in a nightclub would be drinking and now all of a sudden they’ve got a gun in their pocket?”
But he ultimately concludes that “if it were that 10 people who could have had a weapon in that nightclub? That ultimately would have made the situation less horrific than it ended up being. I’m in that camp.”",Mostly False,2016-09-14

A 9 September 2016 report from Cuba’s state news agency Prensa Latina said that Russia and Bolivia were cooperating to bolster Bolivia’s own military and the dealings would involve the “sale of equipment and transfer of technology,” but it made no mention of hundreds of Russian troops landing in Bolivia.
The claimed acts of Russian military expansion were alleged to be in retaliation for a 7 September 2016 incident over the Black Sea in which a U.S. Navy jet (a P-8 Poseidon) had a close encounter with a Russian fighter jet (Sukhoi Su-27). Both sides claimed to be acting within international law and accused the other of wrong-doing. The Russians asserted the U.S. plane was operating without a transponder with the intent of espionage, while the Americans maintained they were conducting routine operations in international airspace when the Russian jets became dangerously aggressive.


The incident occurred amid high tensions between the U.S. and Russia vis-a-vis the Russian Federation’s take-over of the Crimean peninsula, which had until 2014 had been under the administrative control of neighboring Ukraine. However, we found no credible evidence that Russia is going so far as to make a move so outlandishly war-baiting as to plant 50,000 troops at U.S. borders. By way of reference, there were 50,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan in May 2009 when fighting there was intense, according to the Associated Press.
On 1 September 2016, Business Insider reported that Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said a division of troops would be stationed in Chukotka, Russia’s most far-easterly region, which lies just over 50 miles from Alaska:
Broadly, Russia has taken the lead in militarizing and exploring the Arctic region, as melting ice caps open up new shipping lanes between the East and West. In that context, the deployment of a division to the sparsely populated Chukotka region makes sense.
In the past, Russia has bemoaned NATO and US troop deployments near to its borders. How the US will respond to this deployment remains to be seen.
For at least a year, the fact that the Russian military has been ticking up its presence in the region has been known but has not yet been cause for any particular alarm. But it seems unlikely Russia has 50,000 troops there, as the sparse region only has a civilian population of just over 50,000:
Russia has been openly re-establishing its military presence in the Arctic for some time now, and recent satellite imagery may give some insight into Moscow’s intentions. Detailed images collected by Stratfor’s partners at AllSource Analysis clearly show Russia’s ongoing construction and development of several permanent bases in the region. Two in particular, one on Alexandra Island and the other on Kotelny Island, reflect the broader pattern in Russia’s Arctic activity: Moscow is looking to establish a monitoring outpost and stake a symbolic territorial claim, but it has not yet built up a full-blown combat presence.
Russia Today (RT), a Russian state-funded, English language news outlet, has been boasting since 2014 about the country’s Arctic plans as well, and on 15 September 2016 posted a fluff piece about soldiers rescuing an orphaned bear cub.

74,DAVID EMERY,"Did Clinton Supporters Start the ‘Birther’ Movement?
","On 16 September 2016, after years of being the most visible and outspoken exponent of “birtherism” — the notion that, despite all evidence to the contrary, Barack Obama was born outside the U.S. and thus his presidency is illegitimate and his allegiances suspect — GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump stepped up to the podium at a televised campaign event and completely reversed his stance on the matter — but not before trying to lay blame for the long, drawn-out smear campaign on someone else.
“Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it,” Trump said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.”
A press release issued by Trump’s campaign staff elaborated on the accusation:
Hillary Clinton’s campaign first raised this issue to smear then-candidate Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President. This type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook. As usual, however, Hillary Clinton was too weak to get an answer. Even the MSNBC show Morning Joe admits that it was Clinton’s henchmen who first raised this issue, not Donald J. Trump.
In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised. Inarguably, Donald J. Trump is a closer. Having successfully obtained President Obama’s birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States.
The statement is correct when it suggests that the claim that Hillary Clinton invented birtherism isn’t new. It had been made in 2015, for example, on the MSNBC Morning Joe program:
Though it’s true that the specific allegation that Obama wasn’t born in the U.S. first reared its head during the 2008 presidential race, rumblings about Obama’s “otherness” had been percolating since long before that. In 2004, a political gadfly named Andy Martin issued a press release calling Barack Obama a “complete fraud” who had “misrepresented his heritage” in his memoir, Dreams From My Father, and “is a Muslim who has concealed his religion.” The theme was pushed further in December 2006 by conservative columnist Debbie Schlussel, who published an article entitled “Barack Hussein Obama: Once a Muslim, Always a Muslim,” which stated that “Obama has a ‘born-again’ affinity for the nation of his Muslim father, Kenya.” In March 2007, Clinton campaign strategist Mark Penn proposed attacking Obama on the basis of his “lack of American roots.” And, in December 2007, a Clinton volunteer county coordinator in Iowa was fired for forwarding an e-mail making the by-then familiar claim that Obama is a Muslim.
The idea that Obama was born elsewhere, specifically Kenya, was first floated in April 2008, according to a 22 April 2011 Politico article by Ben Smith and Byron Tau on the origins of birtherism:
That theory first emerged in the spring of 2008, as Clinton supporters circulated an anonymous e-mail questioning Obama’s citizenship.
“Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy. She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth,” asserted one chain email that surfaced on the urban legend site Snopes.com in April 2008.
That Hillary Clinton supporters circulated such an e-mail isn’t in question, but the claim that that’s the moment the birther theory “first emerged” simply isn’t true. The likeliest point of origin we’ve been able to find was a post on conservative message board FreeRepublic.com dated 1 March 2008 (which, according to a report in The Telegraph, was at least a month before Clinton supporters got on the e-mail bandwagon):
I was told today that Obama swore in on a Koran for his Senate seat. I do not believe he did. Can someone clarify this for me? I am under the impression only a Congressman has so far sworn in on a Koran.
Also that Obama’s mother gave birth to him overseas and then immediately flew into Hawaii and registered his birth as having taken place in Hawaii.
Again, any clarifications on this? Defintely disqualifies him for Prez. There must be some trace of an airticket. While small babies are not charged air fare they do have a ticket issued for them.
Long time ago but there may be some residual information somewhere. Good ammo (if available and true) BEST USED AFTER he becomes PREZ (if that occurs) and it’s too late for Dems – except accept the VP.
The same rumor was repeated, with elaborations, four days later on the conservative blog Ruthless Roundup:
Add to the family history shown in this article that Obama’s mother was allegedly visiting Kenya with Obama’s father in the final months of her pregnancy and was not allowed to board a flight in her late term to return home.
She allegedly had Obama in Kenya and quickly boarded a flight to Hawaii. Airlines do not accept late term pregancies but do not refuse passage to a newborn, usually issuing a 10% or free fare ticket for the trip.
Once in Hawaii, his mother registered him as being born in Hawaii.
The conspiracy theory was already fully formed at this point. Clearly, the Clinton supporters accused of spreading it via forwarded e-mails knew “good ammo” when they saw it, but, as the above posts show, they deserve neither credit nor blame for the invention of birtherism.",FALSE,2016-09-16
75,KIM LACAPRIA,"Liberals Want to Change the Name of ‘Cracker Barrel’ to ‘Caucasian Barrel’?
","On 8 July 2015, Change.org user Ryan Koch of Des Moines initiated a petition on that site seeking to “Change the name of Cracker Barrel to Caucasian Barrel.” That petition appeared at a time of heightened racial controversy in the United States: in particular, while debate was ongoing about whether display of the Confederate flag should be retired to primarily historical contexts in the wake of a racially-motivated shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina, church on 17 June 2015.
The petition facetiously suggested that the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store chain of restaurants and gift shops employed an “offensive slur” in its name:
I say all of us European Americans start protesting C****er Barrel. It uses an offensive slur and it is deeply offensive and mocks our long and proud heritage.
The name is offensive, their logo stereotypes European Americans as people who sit on chairs and lean against what appears to be a bourbon barrel, claiming we are all a bunch of alcoholics. Sure, they’ll SAY it’s a “cracker” barrel but everyone knows crackers don’t come in barrels, they come in bags and boxes!
Change the name C****er Barrel to Caucasian Barrel. After all, white people should have something to be offended by, too!
The petition was popular on social media sites, where some users found it clever (and others claimed the joke as their own):


I demand that Cracker Barrel immediately change its name to Caucasian Barrel because I am offended



Since @Redskins name is offensive, we should change the @CrackerBarrel name next. #RedskinsNation 

We need to change the name Cracker Barrel to Caucasian Barrel. I find the word ‘cracker’ highly offensive. — Tyler Lovett (@DontYouLovett) July 10, 2015

The petition suggested the name “Cracker Barrel” was suspect, as “everyone knows crackers don’t come in barrels.” However, an obituary for Cracker Barrel founder Dan Evins published in the Washington Post in 2012 gave the following explanation for the chain’s nomenclature:
To distinguish his station from others, he added a small restaurant and gift shop and called the outfit Cracker Barrel — a reference to old-time country stores where people played checkers atop barrels used to carry crackers and other wares.
According to NPR, the pejorative term “cracker” was essentially “reclaimed” by poor white people well before the Cracker Barrel chain existed:
By the early 1800s, those immigrants to the South started to refer to themselves that way as a badge of honor and a term of endearment.


After his tongue-in-cheek petition garnered a good deal of attention, Ryan Koch clarified that it was not meant to be regarded as anything other than a form of satirical expression:
I started this satirical petition in lieu [sic] of constant media reports of various groups and organizations constantly wanting to change things throughout the country because they claim they are offended.
The petition was meant to shed light on how ridiculous all of the political correctness currently going on in the country is, and how we should focus on real issues such as crime, unemployment, veteran suicide, and corrupt politics rather than cater to everyone who feels they need to be offended.
I do not in any way feel the need for, or want Cracker Barrel to change their name. I do not have any ill feelings towards the restaurant chain, and I enjoy dining at their locations frequently. I am not expecting a response from Cracker Barrel in regards to this petition, as they were not involved in the creation of it.
Neither Cracker Barrel nor anyone who reads the petition should take its purpose of changing the name seriously.
The petition is strictly for satirical and comedic purposes to show how ridiculous political correctness is getting in America.
Cracker Barrel themselves said of the issue that:
Cracker Barrel is aware of this satirical petition and recognizes that individuals have the right to express their opinion on all types of things. At Cracker Barrel, our mission is Pleasing People. While we respect the opinions of these individuals, our brand is well-known as a home away from home so we have no plans to change our name as it is synonymous with great food and great service.
Thousands of people have since signed the “Change the name of Cracker Barrel to Caucasian Barrel” petition, but it doesn’t seem many (if any) considered the missive anything other than a critique of a culture that detractors feel has become too sensitive.
On 15 September 2016, a web site covered the ancient nontroversy and revived the rumor that “liberals” sought to change the name of Cracker Barrel, but the petition on which that claim was based remains purely a satirical one.",FALSE,2016-09-21
