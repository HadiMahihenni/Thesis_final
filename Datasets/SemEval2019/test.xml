	<article id="0000635" published-at="2017-07-25" title="Coward With Terminal Brain Cancer Jumps Out Of Government-Funded Death Bed To Kill Other Sick People"><p>The line of Republican cowards attempting to curry favor with Donald Trump stretches out the door, around the building, down the block, through the next door overflow room, and extends up to space, where it circles around the moon like Dr Manhattan. There's sniveling turdface Ted Cruz, who, among other things, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/23/9-truly-awful-things-that-were-said-between-ted-cruz-and-the-man-hell-now-support-donald-trump/?utm_term=.edfe1aa3a681" type="external">listened to Trump call his wife ugly and his dad a traitor and a murderer.</a> There's J Crew crewneck used to wipe pig vomit off of a misspelled yield sign Paul Ryan, who Trump has basically played the one-way dozens with for three years. And of course there's Most Racist Cracker Barrel Manager Ever Jefferson Sessions, who's remained mute as a Nazi church mouse as Trump continues to drink his milkshake on Twitter every day.</p> <p>But none of these cowards compare to the cowardice standard exhibited by John McCain; whose cowardice is legion and legendary, massive and magnificent. It's been only two years since Darth Cheeto — who was then still just Anakin Skyrapist — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/18/trump-slams-mccain-for-being-captured-in-vietnam/?utm_term=.f6dda0a2afcd" type="external">doubted McCain's war hero bonafides</a> and added (quite humorously, I must admit) "I like people that weren’t captured." And now, here's McCain jumping out of his government-funded death futon to deny government-funded death futons to other sick people, all to support a President who disrespected the fuck out of him and whose only substantive agenda and platform is to erase everything the preceding President did.</p> <p>Again, Washington is full of cowards. But what makes McCain's cowardice special is that his whole entire personal and political brand is bravery. Well, "bravery." You expect people like Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan to be rats. But John McCain has created, attached himself to, and submerged himself in this maverick narrative; that he's somehow different from the rest of those craven motherfuckers. That he does what he does, but does what he does with integrity. And this story only exists and has been able to persist because he was a bad pilot. His "bravery" is to bravery what Arby's "roast beef" is to roast beef. Fuck him.</p></article>

Then the scandals started catching up to her. Let’s recap her sordid history.</p> <p>Appointed by Obama in 2011, <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/04/oregon_us_attorney_amanda_mars.html" type="external">Marshall resigned in 2015</a> after <a href="http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-32952-u-s-attorney-amanda-marshall-allegedly-stalked-subordinate.html" type="external">allegedly stalking a subordinate</a> and having an affair, and later faced internal probes (no pun intended).</p> <p><a href="http://kval.com/news/local/a-sentence-grossly-disproportionate-to-the-severity-of-the-offenses-here" type="external">Marshall is the DA who pursued charges, even to the point of double jeopardy, against Dwight and Steven Hammond</a>, the eastern Oregon ranchers who preemptively set controlled burns to stop wildfires from encroaching on their property. After already serving time in federal prison, Marshall encouraged the judge to re-imprison them for a harsher sentence. Those actions are what prompted the Malheur Wildlife Refuge protests in early 2016.</p> <p>In 2014, <a href="http://www.progressivestoday.com/you-wont-believe-what-these-anti-gun-folks-are-openly-saying/" type="external">Marshall was caught on camera conspiring with Gabby Gifford’s gun control group</a>, Americans For Responsible Solutions, to scheme up new gun control laws and propaganda.

A panel will convene, likely sometime in the spring, to determine if Marshall has engaged in misconduct. Punishment for ethics violations range from a public reprimand to a suspension or disbarment.</p> <p>The disciplinary board identified two rules Marshall may have violated, one involving criminal conduct that reflects poorly on a lawyer’s honesty and trustworthiness or fitness and the other dealing with conduct involving fraud and dishonesty.</p> <p>Marshall’s lawyer, Allison Martin Rhodes, said Monday that Marshall “has always acknowledged” that she “was not completely truthful” when asked by a superior about the relationship.</p> <p>Martin Rhodes has said Marshall lied when asked if she had sex with her subordinate but was subsequently forthcoming in a four-hour interview with authorities.</p> <p>The professional standards agency opened an investigation last year after the U.S. Department of Justice’s inspector general found Marshall had engaged in a yearlong “intimate and personal” relationship with a subordinate.</p> <p>The inspector general said Marshall, who now practices law in McMinnville, violated sexual harassment laws, lied to investigators and tried to block the investigation.</p> <p>The Inspector General’s Office in March 2015 opened an investigation of Marshall. She took a leave of absence that month, citing health reasons that included post-traumatic stress disorder. She officially resigned on May 15, 2015, amid the internal review.</p> </q> <p>It’s just fitting that someone with ties to the Obama administration and anti-gun organizations is caught up in a series of scandals and lies.</p> <p>Sponsored</p> <p>Sponsored</p></article>

	<article id="0000644" published-at="2017-10-11" title="Hollywood Actors Who Condemn Trump but Were Silent on Weinstein"><p>Ashley Judd is the absolute worst.</p> <p>I want to like her, I really do. Sometimes she chooses a good cause, like speaking up for trafficked and abused children. Those are the activities she should stick to. Unfortunately, Judd had to go to the "Women's March," where hundreds of thousands of women wore pink "pussy" hats while claiming to be upset that Trump had used that word once. She performed ridiculous slam poetry, screeching defamatory accusations about the president wanting to have sex with his daughter and about other terrible things about which she had no first-hand knowledge. (You can watch the video below if you have the stomach for it.)</p> <p>But at no time did she ever discuss a man who she did know did horrific things. No "by the way, Harvey Weinstein is a dirtbag who tried to get me to watch him shower for a part." Why didn't that come up?</p> <p>I find it very difficult to believe Judd is this angry at Donald Trump, a man who has never done anything to her, or provably to anybody, when there is a man who did do something horrible to her whom she could be screeching about. She needs therapy. And possibly tranquilizers.</p> <p>Jennifer Lawrence was recently interviewed for her epic fail of a movie, Mother, and gave Democratic talking points like "equality for women in the workplace," blamed Trump for hurricanes, and rattled off the same tired Leftist arguments we've heard forever. During another interview, she claimed that she is terrified of Trump and wanted to make a video of herself saying "F*** you!" to him.</p> <p>Lawrence claimed she felt she could be a spokesperson for women who are underpaid:</p> <q>
 I felt like I had a voice, people look at me and listen to me, and to not say anything, that's never sat well with me. </q> <p>That seems disingenuous, because she kept quiet about the creepy mogul who everyone in Hollywood appears to have known was abusing women. Why stay quiet over that? Don't you have a responsibility to alert other women that there is a serial sexual predator in their midst? Lawrence hasn't alleged any harassment from Weinstein, although she is seen looking awkward in many photos with him while he holds her too close to his massive girth. It wouldn't surprise me if she had first-hand knowledge of his depravity.</p> <p>Gwyneth Paltrow is the most apolitical in this list. While she supported Obama, she never had anything more interesting to say beyond how handsome she thinks he is. Mostly she spends her life divorcing people and selling outrageously priced trinkets to rich women online. While she doesn't fit in the category of commenting on Trump, she bears much responsibility in this scandal.</p></article>
